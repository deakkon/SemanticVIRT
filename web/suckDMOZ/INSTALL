suckDMOZ - Installation + Instructions
-------------------------

Pretty simple installation assuming you have PHP installed to run from the command line (see php.net for instructions on this if you don't) and a MySQL database set up.  You will need a user/pass with rights to create a table in the database

Just copy the four files to your working directory:
suckDMOZ_config.php
suckDMOZ_content_parser.php
suckDMOZ_structure_parser.php
suckDMOZ_dbconnect.php

Chmod them to 777 or whatever... so they're executable.

Get the latest RDF's from DMOZ (http://dmoz.org/rdf.html) and copy them to the same directory.

Set the variables in suckDMOZ_config.php to be correct for you.

Run 'php -q suckDMOZ_content_parser.php > DMOZ_content_parser_result.txt &' to parse the content RDF

Run 'php -q suckDMOZ_content_parser.php > DMOZ_content_parser_result.txt &' to parse the structure RDF

It will create both tables, "DMOZ_structure" and "DMOZ_content" for you if they don't exist.

Sit back and wait...
	I originally wrote this about a year ago and haven't run it in a while, but I think it took over a week and built over 20 million rows for the content table alone.  It was running on a 450 MHz machine running RHLinux7.

Now's a good time to send me a small thanks in the form of $25 to my address in the CREDITS doc... hey man I just saved you some serious dough in time spent figuring this out for yourself!! ;)


NOTES/TODOS:

The original parse of the RDF file will take like 10 minutes before you start to see activity in the 'parser_result.txt' file, then you should see updates every 20-30 minutes (depending on the speed of your machine)

Like I said above, this takes a long time to run, meaning days not hours, so put this on an extra box when you run it cause it will chew up a lot of resources.

The Approx MPH is kinda silly, I just wanted to get an idea of how fast it was running since it seemed to be slower as the table got larger.  It doesn't seem to work too well, maybe someone can fix it!

It seems to lose about 50-10% of the data from the RDF.  I haven't debugged it enough to figure out why/where it's happening - another fix waiting to happen!
