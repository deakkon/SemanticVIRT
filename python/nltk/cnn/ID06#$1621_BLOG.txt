		The &#039;Lost&#039; finale: ABC makes a night of it	
			
ABC is seeking to make an all-night event out of the series finale of &#034;Lost&#034; on Sunday, May 23. TheWrap.com reports that prior to the two-hour episode that night at 9 p.m. ET, there will be a two-hour retrospective. Then later that night, one of the most famous &#034;Lost&#034; fanatics, Jimmy Kimmel, will do a special &#034;Jimmy Kimmel Live&#034; in honor of the show.
So, &#034;Lost&#034; fans will be able to get their fill of the show - and then some - on the final night with five full hours of programming.
