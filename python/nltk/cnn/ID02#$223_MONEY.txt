In 2009, 12% of all international calling minutes were made through Skype, he said, up from 8% in 2008.&quot;This is a huge milestone for Skype, and we're looking to keep launching apps and creating more partnerships,&quot; Silverman said. &quot;We're just a six-year-old company and we are definitely looking to expand.&quot;&nbsp;
