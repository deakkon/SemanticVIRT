Gaga and Lauper told CNN's &quot;Connect The World&quot; women &quot;need to put their foot down&quot; in the bedroom. &quot;Cyndi is a lot of my inspiration,&quot; Gaga said, before relating how she and Lauper had met playing gay clubs in gay neighborhoods. Lauper replied: &quot;That's very sweet. You know I get inspired by her. I get inspired to remember myself.&quot; Pop icon Gaga, who has enjoyed worldwide success thanks to songs such as &quot;Poker Face,&quot; &quot;Just Dance&quot; and &quot;Telephone&quot; is known as much for her distinctive fashion sense and extravagant performances as she is for her music.

But she told CNN's Becky Anderson that she was surprised a viewer had asked her whether she wrote her own songs. &quot;People are asking that question?&quot; queried Gaga. &quot;I have written every single song I have ever sang and also produced a lot of the music.&quot; Gaga and Lauper are on a mission, along with cosmetics giant MAC, to ensure women are tested for HIV and AIDS. &quot;This is not a gay disease, this is a disease plaguing women,&quot; said Gaga. &quot;And I just want to clarify that. Because I think that's the very sort of pre-assumption, that women aren't getting tested and allowing negotiations to go on in the bedroom and are not putting their foot down.&quot;  Lauper added: &quot;I lost a lot of friends in the eighties and nineties and it was a big heartbreak and I can't just stand by.&quot; Gaga said that she had been a fan of MAC since she was young. &quot;MAC is a lifestyle, it is sort of this place and Mecca near my house where I could be who I wanted to be and find myself as an individual.&quot; She described being a role model to girls and young women as being not a burden but a privilege. &quot;I'm so blessed that I'm here,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm absolutely not one of those people who's a self-obsessed, masturbatory artist who doesn't care about my fans or my effect on my fans. I have a very keen understanding of my effect or what I can do. &quot;And when you're in the public eye you're a role model whether you want to be or not. And I want to be.&quot;  But both women were evasive on a possible collaboration with another blonde icon -- Madonna. &quot;I don't know,&quot; said Lauper. &quot;Who knows? You always keep it open.&quot;
