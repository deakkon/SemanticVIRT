 Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A drone attack in Pakistan's northwest tribal region killed four suspected militants Wednesday, officials said. The strike took place in a village near the city of Miranshah in North Waziristan, two intelligence officials said. The attack destroyed a car and a compound, said the officials who did not want to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. North Waziristan is one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border. The United States is the only country in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones, which are controlled remotely. U.S. officials normally do not comment on suspected drone strikes, which have caused tension between Pakistan and the United States in the past. Based on a CNN count, there have been 15 drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal region this year. Fourteen have targeted locations in North Waziristan.Journalist Nasir Dawar contributed to this report.
