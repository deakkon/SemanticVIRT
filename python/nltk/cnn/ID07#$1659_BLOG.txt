		Elton John speaks openly about mistakes	
			
Elton John didn’t hold back during his recent interview with Parade.
The rock-star turned philanthropist spoke openly about the mistakes he made in past relationships - from getting involved with drugs to acting like a caretaker rather than an equal.
&#034;I&#039;d always choose someone younger,” he told Parade. “I wanted to smother them with love. I&#039;d take them around the world, try to educate them. One after another they got a Cartier watch, a Versace outfit, maybe a sports car. They didn&#039;t have jobs. They were reliant on me. I did this repeatedly. In six months they were bored and hated my guts because I&#039;d taken their lives and self-worth away. I hadn&#039;t intended to.” 
And as far as John’s former drug habit:
&#034;I set up my foundation because I wanted to make amends for the years I was a drug addict. People with HIV are still stigmatized. The infection rates are going up. People are dying. The political response is appalling. The sadness of it, the waste.&#034;
Despite the hardships he endured, many of which stemmed from being in the limelight - “Fame attracts lunatics. I never had a bodyguard, ever, until Gianni [Versace] died. I don&#039;t like celebrity anymore&#034; – John moves forward.
“I think Jesus was a compassionate, super-intelligent gay man who understood human problems. On the cross, he forgave the people who crucified him. Jesus wanted us to be loving and forgiving. I don’t know what makes people so cruel. Try being a gay woman in the Middle East - you’re as good as dead.”
