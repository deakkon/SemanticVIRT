		Aerosmith gets ready to tour - including Steven Tyler	
			
All those rumors about Aerosmith replacing legendary frontman Steven Tyler have turned out to be untrue, according to a press release announcing the band&#039;s upcoming European tour.
&#034;Back by popular demand with more spit and fire than ever before, we&#039;re coming across the pond and parting the waters as we go,&#034; Tyler said in the statement.
Certainly this moment is met by a sigh of relief for music fans, because just a few months ago, it appeared as though one of the most iconic bands in the industry was falling apart.

In November, lead guitarist Joe Perry told CNN that the band was searching for a new lead singer, and then in December, Tyler entered rehab for an addiction to painkillers.
But this summer, as drummer Joey Kramer put it in the release, Aerosmith - with all of its members - will be back, &#034;Bigger, better and stronger than ever!&#034;
The Cocked, Locked, Ready to Rock tour kicks off at the Sweden Rock Festival on June 10, with the rest of the tour dates currently scheduled as follows:
UK - Download Festival - June 13
UK - London 02 Arena - June 15
Romania - Bucharest - June 18
Greece - Athens Olympic Stadium - June 20
Holland - Nijmegen Goeffert Park - June 23
