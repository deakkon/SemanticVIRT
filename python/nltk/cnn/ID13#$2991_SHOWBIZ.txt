 (The Frisky) -- Over the weekend, Jason Mesnick and Molly Malaney tied the knot -- we'll see it unfold on television on March 8 -- becoming the first &quot;Bachelor&quot; couple to actually make it down the aisle, news that we can only applaud since Melissa Rycroft recently got hitched as well.  And tonight, Jake Pavleka will make his final decision and propose to either nudey-pic Vienna or Disney Princess Tenley. Rumor has it that Vienna will be his final choice, though meanwhile the whole world is expressing a strong preference for Tenley.  But before Jake flies off into the sunset with either of these ladies, we thought we'd take a look back and catch you up on where some of the &quot;Bachelor&quot; and &quot;Bachelorette&quot; contestants past have ended up. The Frisky: Figure skating outfits inspired by Tom Cruise and other celebrity fashion moments &#8226; Bachelor numero uno, Alex Michel, works as a &quot;media industry exec in New York City,&quot; which sounds sketchily vague to me. He also consults for Princess Cruises' Department of Romance as their &quot;proposal expert.&quot; He's long broken up with show winner Amanda March and has moved on to a new lady. &quot;With my girlfriend, her dad watched the entire show right before meeting me, which was probably not the best introduction,'' he told Entertainment Weekly. ''But I think it ended up OK because he was so pleasantly surprised that I was nice and focused only on his daughter.'' The Frisky: Should Angelina Jolie play 40-something Kay Scarpetta? And other casting calls that upset fans &#8226; Heather Cranford appeared on two seasons of the &quot;Bachelor&quot; and got dumped by both Aaron Buerge and Byron Velvick. After that, she says she swore off dating. Until she re-met a dude she went to high school with, and they ended up getting married. &quot;We lived three streets away from each other growing up,&quot; she says. &quot;He was in my own backyard.&quot; Heather also appeared on &quot;Battle of the Network Reality Stars&quot; and is a reporter for a local fishing television show. &#8226; I will fully admit to forming a big crush on Andrew Firestone, &quot;Bachelor&quot; No. 3. He is still working for his family's wineries, and has stayed away from showbiz. ''I didn't want to mess up my credibility by trying to chase the Hollywood thing,&quot; he said. He has found love -- he married a model named Ivana Bozilovic and they had their first baby last year. &#8226; Bob Guiney, &quot;Bachelor&quot; No. 4, went from insurance company owner to media dude after the show. He's hosted a few series, most recently TLC's &quot;Date My House,&quot; and before that Country Music Television's &quot;Trick My Truck.&quot; He also married &quot;All My Children&quot; star Rebecca Budig in 2004, but they recently split up. Luckily his band, Band From TV, featuring Teri Hatcher and Hugh Laurie, has stayed together. &#8226; &quot;Bachelorette&quot; Meredith Phillips quickly broke up with the dude of her dreams, Ian McKee, and changed careers pretty drastically -- she quit her fashion industry job and went to culinary school. Last year, she published &quot;The Date Night Cookbook,&quot; based on the meals she and new boyfriend Fritz (whom she met in school) make for each other. The Frisky: 10 celebs accused of boosting their bust &#8226; Fisherman hunk Byron Velvick had a rough ride with his &quot;Bachelor&quot; pick, Mary Delgado. After a few years together, Mary was arrested for assaulting Byron and sucker-punching him. They got back together afterward and Byron said, &quot;Just because you met on a reality show, got engaged on this incredible setting doesn't mean that we're Prince Charming or Beautiful Princess.&quot; They stayed together until last December. Byron now hosts a show on ESPN2 about saltwater fishing called &quot;Going Coastal.&quot; &#8226; Lorenzo Borghese was icky, if you ask me. After breaking up with the show's winner and dating the runner-up, he's super single. He owns a chain of pet spas and a social networking site for pet owners called NuzzlePlanet.com. He is also currently writing a romance novel. &quot;I'm responding to your questions on my Blackberry as I drink a beer on the beach and watch the sunset in Florian&oacute;polis, Brazil,'' he told Entertainment Weekly in an interview last year. The Frisky: What is the ideal age to get married? &#8226; DeAnna Pappas was my favorite &quot;Bachelorette.&quot; She broke up with snowboarder Jesse Csincsak soon after the show, but landed a gig as the co-host of Lifetime's &quot;Get Married,&quot; which brings brides and event planners wedding ideas. Too bad it's on at 7:30 a.m. Now she's dating Steve Stagliano, the twin brother of Mike Stagliano, who was on Jillian Harris' season of &quot;The Bachelorette.&quot; Mike, incidentally, is dating Holly Durst, who was rejected by Matt Grant, the British &quot;Bachelor.&quot; Whew.TM & &#169 2010 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved
