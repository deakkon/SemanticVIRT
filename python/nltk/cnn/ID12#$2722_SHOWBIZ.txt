 Video analytics company Visible Measures - the one we work with to put out our monthly top 10 webisodes chart - curates a list of video called the &quot;100 Million Club.&quot; It includes all the web videos that have exceeded 100 million views. Lady Gaga has long been a staple of the chart, but now she's essentially in a club all her own: She's the first franchise to reach one billion views. Gaga's music videos hold three spots in the 65-video 100 Million Club - one for &quot;Poker Face&quot; (374,606,128), one for &quot;Just Dance&quot; (272,941,674) and one for &quot;Bad Romance&quot; (360,020,327). Add them up and you get just over one billion views. She won't occupy the club alone for long, though; the Twilight saga is close behind with 980 million and Soulja Boy is at 860 million. Gaga is primarily a hit on Vevo and YouTube; 25% of Vevo's visitors only have eyes for her. The pop star has attracted Internet attention elsewhere, too. A Facebook group of more than 100,000 people initiated National Lady Gaga Day about a month ago, and her latest Internet hit is her &quot;Telephone&quot; music video with Beyonc&eacute;. The point is, you can't escape Gaga on the Internet. She's everywhere right now. We welcome speculation as to exactly why the web loves her so, so let us know in the comments if you have any ideas.&copy; 2010 MASHABLE.com.
