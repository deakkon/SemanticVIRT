Al-Sadr, in Iran to complete his religious studies, called for the demonstration. The turnout reflects his strong grassroots popularity. The demonstrators waved Iraqi flags, religious banners and posters of al-Sadr and his late father, who was an ayatollah.
U.S. troops swept into the Iraqi capital 20 days after the U.S.-led invasion began in late March of 2003.
The protesters shouted many slogans: &#034;No for occupation, yes for freedom&#034;; &#034;You occupiers get out of our country&#034;; &#034;No no for occupation&#034;; &#034;No no for America&#034;; &#034;No no for Israel&#034; and &#034;No no for the devil.&#034; Using chains, they dragged British, American and Israeli flags and a vehicle resembling a U.S. tank.
&#034;We want the occupiers to leave our country immediately,&#034; said Haider Naser, one of Sadr&#039;s supporters.
