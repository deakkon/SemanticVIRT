2010 NCAA Tournament Projection


Selection Sunday is March 14, but here's what 2010 NCAA Tournament field looks like as of right now. Note: The top-four 

seeds in each region, starting with the No. 1 seeds, receive geographic preference when possible. An imbalance in 

high seeds between regions (e.g. if more 

than two top-four seeds are closest to the same subregional location) may force a protected seed into a secondary 

location. Thus, in the next couple weeks, shifts 

in seeding will alter which subregions fall into which regions. In this bracket, the Midwest matches 

up with the West, the South with the East in the national semifinals.</i>

New multi-bid conference teams in: UAB, Connecticut, Dayton.Multi-bid conference teams out: San Diego State, Charlotte, Rhode 

Island.Also considered: San Diego State, Minnesota, Notre Dame, Cincinnati, Charlotte, Rhode Island.Bids by conference: Big 

East (8), ACC and Big 12 (7), Big Ten and SEC (5), Atlantic 10 (4), Mountain West (3), Conference USA and West Coast (2).Auto bids in smaller 

conferences were determined by best RPI among all first-place (e.g. fewest losses) teams in the league. One-bid league winners and select other auto-bid 

teams are listed with their conference for clarity. Teams can be moved a seed line up or down to conform to bracketing rules. BRIEF 

THOUGHTSWhy they made it:-- UConn: Starting to win its fair share of games against brutal schedule. Early losses against 

elite teams were very competitive. Looks the part more than some of the other options.-- UAB: Only 1-2 vs. top 50, but 5-1 vs. 51-100, so they 

have shown some quality. Second-place team in a competitive C-USA. 11-3 road/neutral record, beat Cincinnati and Butler out of conference.-- 

Dayton: Reexamination of resume along with worse losses by Charlotte and Rhode Island push Flyers up A-10 pecking order. No double-digit losses 

against very rigorous schedule (13 top-100 games), with five losses vs. RPI top 20. Chose A-10 No. 4 over MWC No. 4 with better wins and better 

schedule.Why they didn't make it:-- San Diego State: Barely made it last week and then lost convincingly at BYU. Only 3-7 vs. 

RPI top 100 and 2-4 vs. top three in MWC.-- Minnesota: Illinois was first decent true road win, still only 5-9 vs. top 100, missed chance to 

take out Purdue when Robbie Hummel went down. Would have made bracket had baseline J at buzzer gone. Tough justice? Gophers have three one-point 

losses and two others in OT.-- Notre Dame: Not enough quality wins yet to overcome overall weakness of profile. One great week doesn't 

override a mediocre season just yet.-- Cincinnati: Sweep of UConn is not enough to be ahead of the Huskies on overall merit. Too many losses 

in league and overall.
