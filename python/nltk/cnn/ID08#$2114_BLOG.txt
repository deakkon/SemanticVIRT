Wikipedia wasÂ offline Wednesday afternoon after an overheating problem at the online encyclopedia&#039;s European data center.
Wikipedia&#039;s technical blog said the site&#039;s servers shut themselves down to avoid damage from the heat.
Administrators tried to shift traffic to a cluster of servers in Florida, but &#034;it turned out that this failover mechanism was now broken, causing the DNS resolution of Wikimedia sites to stop working globally,&#034; according to the blog.
&#034;This problem was quickly resolved, but unfortunately it may take up to an hour before access is restored for everyone, due to caching effects,&#034; the blog said.
Trying to access wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org at about 2:45 p.m. ET produced a navigation error message.
One post to Wikipedia&#039;s technical blog, by a user named Jimmy, found some humor in the situation: &#034;And so we remember Thursday, March 25, 2010 as the day every English speaking student failed their research papers.&#034;
