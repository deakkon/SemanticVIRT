2010 NFL Mock Draft 5.0 (cont.)










&nbsp;











21


WR
Dez Bryant</a>
Oklahoma State</a>
Jr.
6-2
215








The Bengals have some intriguing options with Bryant, USC safety Taylor Mays and Oklahoma tight end Jermaine 

Gresham still available. But even with Antonio Bryant signed during free agency, the chance to land the draft's top 

receiver is too good to pass up. As far as Bryant's character questions, Cincy has a bit of experience in that department, and 

the Bengals were kicking the tires on Terrell Owens last month. 










22

DE-OLB
Sergio Kindle</a>
Texas</a>
Sr.
6-4
255




Penn State defensive tackle Jared Odrick and Oklahoma tight end Jermaine Gresham remain viable options, but the 

Patriots still need to boost their pass rush and Kindle is a 3-4 outside linebacker prospect who plays in the other team's 

backfield.









23

OT
Bruce Campbell</a>
Maryland</a>
Jr.
6-7
310






Rutgers cornerback Devin McCourty is the other name to know for the Packers, but finding more options for an offensive 

line that gave up a league-worst 51 sacks last seaon remains the most pressing issue in Green Bay. Campbell isn't ready to 

start from day one, but with veteran tackles Mark Tauscher and Chad Clifton both re-signed, he would have the 

benefit of some patience from the Packers. 








24

S
Taylor Mays</a>
USC</a>
Sr.
6-3
230







The Eagles have a lot of picks to play with, and with the second-rounder they got from Washington in hand, a trade-up for a 

safety like Eric Berry is a rumor that makes some sense. But barring something that dramatic, sticking at No. 24 and 

taking the physically gifted Mays is a solid option.








25

TE
Jermaine Gresham</a>
Oklahoma</a>
Sr.
6-5
259





The Ravens are stocked at receiver now with Anquan Boldin and Donte Stallworth on board, but they still covet a 

play-making tight end who gives them more downfield than Todd Heap has been able to muster in recent years. Gresham is 

the best the draft has to offer on that front. A cornerback like McCourty would be an excellent Plan B.








26

OLB
Jerry Hughes</a>
TCU</a>
Sr.
6-2
257




Even with Joey Porter signed last month, the Cardinals are in the market for more impact off the edge. With Weatherspoon 

and Kindle both gone, Hughes is a player who holds solid late-first round value. A defensive tackle like Penn State's Jared 

Odrick is another option.









27

S
Nate Allen</a>
South Florida</a>
Sr.
6-1
207






The Cowboys could still use an offensive tackle to integrate into their lineup, but USC's Charles Brown is the only 

consideration remaining, and he doesn't carry a consensus first-round grade. Allen's name has surfaced in connection with the 

Cowboys, and as rumors go, it has the ring of truth.







28

DT
Jared Odrick</a>
Penn State</a>
Sr.
6-5
296




With no first-round worthy running back remaining, the Chargers will have to wait until round two to fill that need. Odrick is 

a great value this low in the round, and he can play in either the 3-4 or 4-3 formation. Alabama's run-stopping defensive 

tackle Terrence Cody would fill the void left by Jamal Williams, if San Diego opts to go in that direction.









29

WR
Demaryius Thomas</a>
Georgia Tech</a>
Sr.
6-3
226




Another big, play-making option in the receiving game should make quarterback Mark Sanchez even better in year two. 

Thomas has conjured up comparisons with Detroit's Calvin Johnson, and the 2010 Jets are in the position to be patient. 









30

QB
Jimmy Clausen</a>
Notre Dame</a>
Jr.
6-3
223




We've got two more mocks after this one to predict how Clausen's situation shakes out, but for now we see him sinking to unexpected 

depths in this year's first round. The Vikings would be one of the few teams in the luxury position to take a quarterback of 

the future, with or without any assurances of Brett Favre playing again this year. If Clausen goes higher, the Vikings' choice 

could come down to Rutgers cornerback Devin McCourty or Florida center-guard Maurkice Pouncey.











31

C
Maurkice Pouncey</a>
Florida</a>
Jr.
6-5
312







The Colts offensive line could use some youth, and Pouncey gives Indy an ideal replacement for Pro Bowl center Jeff 

Saturday, who has to be nearing the end of his long and superb run. 










32

DE
Everson Griffen</a>
USC</a>
Jr.
6-3
280




The defending champs have use for a 4-3 end to fill the hole created by the released Charles Grant. Griffen or Florida's 

Carlos Dunlap figure to be the choice, but while the ex-Gator's upside is higher, the ex-Trojan is the safer selection.
