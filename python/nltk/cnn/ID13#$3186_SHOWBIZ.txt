 (The Frisky) -- Fine, so you didn't exactly need a functioning crystal ball to predict last night's big Oscar winners.  Christoph Waltz won for best supporting actor for &quot;Inglourious Basterds,&quot; Mo'Nique won best supporting actress for &quot;Precious,&quot; Jeff Bridges won best actor for &quot;Crazy Heart,&quot; and Sandra Bullock won best actress for &quot;The Blind Side.&quot; They were the exact same four to walk to the podium for both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards, too.  Best picture was a semi toss-up -- &quot;Avatar&quot; had won at the Golden Globes, while &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; had cleaned up at other less mainstream awards shows -- and volume ended up being the better predictor, as &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; was the ultimate victor last night.  Honestly, the only true surprise of the evening was in the best foreign language film category, where the Oscar was expected to go to &quot;Un Prophete&quot; or &quot;The White Ribbon,&quot; but instead &quot;El Secreto de Sus Ojos&quot; pulled off the upset.  The Frisky: Oscar curse? Win an award, have heartache  So how did we at The Frisky fare with our predictions?

&#8226; Oscar Theory #1: Best actress goes to America's sweetheart  Totally turned out true, as Sandra Bullock came out the victor over the actress's actresses, Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren, and the newbies, Carey Mulligan and Gabourey Sidibe. &#8226; Oscar Theory #2: Best actor goes to the dude with the most mominations  Because three of the competitors this year had five nominations under their belt -- Jeff Bridges, George Clooney, and Morgan Freeman -- we predicted Jeff Bridges would win since two of Clooney's noms were for writing/directing and Freeman had already won an Oscar. We were absolutely right.  The Frisky: 10 celebs with religious tattoos   &#8226; Oscar Theory #3: The breakout star gets best supporting actress  We predicted Mo'Nique for making the switch from stand-up/roles on shows like &quot;The Parkers&quot; to serious actress. We were right. &#8226; Oscar Theory #4: Best supporting actor goes to the creepy guy  Based on this theory, we thought the race would come down to two exceptionally creepy roles: Christoph Waltz's Nazi to Stanley Tucci's mass murderer. We predicted an upset, since we decided that Tucci's character was just a little creepier than Waltz's. That'll show us to go for the unexpected. We were wrong. &#8226; Oscar Theory #5: Best actress gets divorced  It's far too early to tell if this one is true, but we are so hoping it isn't. Sandra Bullock and Jesse James are just too amazing together. &#8226; Oscar Theory #6: The most positive name wins best picture  Sigh. We were wrong here. Based on this pattern, we thought &quot;Precious&quot; would be the upset, since the name would catch Academy voters' eyes and fill them with positive thoughts. Didn't happen. &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; won. Is this theory out the door? The Frisky: The good, bad, and the ridiculous on the Oscar red carpet  &#8226; Oscar Theory #7: Sing in a movie, get an award  Over the years, we noticed that major acting awards often go to those who show their vocal chops. Totally proved true this year with Jeff Bridges' winning for his pipes in &quot;Crazy Heart.&quot;  So, that leaves us with four out of six correct, with a potential for one more to come true down the road -- even if we hope it doesn't. That's not bad, but not exactly good either. How did your Oscar predictions pan out?TM & &#169 2010 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved
