  If nothing else, Al Davis will stop at nothing to make sure that the Raiders will be able to kick the football in various capacities. Following up last season's record deal for punter Shane Lechler, Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski has just received the same deal as Lechler, a 4 year deal worth a total of $16 million including $9 million in guaranteed money. Apparently this is the most money ever for a kicker. So that's good. I guess it is finally time for the Raiders to start working on offense and defense. Also special teams that don't include the punter and kicker. The Raiders extended their own NFL record last season by losing at least 11 games in seven straight seasons now.



Sebastian Janikowski
#11      /               Kicker /      Oakland Raiders

Height: 6-2
Weight: 250
Born: Mar 03, 1978
College: Florida State

Speaking of guys who are soon to be rich, since the Raiders traded  their first round pick in 2011 to the Patriots for Richard Seymour, who  is now an UFA, it seems like Al will open up his coin purse yet again  for another free agent after spending big on Lechler, Janikowski, and  Nmandi Asomugha. According to the article linked to above, they will  franchise tag him if a deal can't be worked out.
Speaking of working out deals, does Al Davis just like to mess with  Tom Cable or what? Although all the signs point toward Cable coming back  as head coach next season, Davis has continually blown off Cable during  the off season and has yet to formally tell coach Cable if he will be  back next season or not. Cable has said he thinks he'll be back so I  guess no news is good news if you are Tom Cable. Maybe Al is just  messing with him by testing him to see if he can keep his composure  while not being told his future and not punch anyone else out in the  future.
Speaking of crappy coaches, when the Chiefs let go DC  Clancy  Pendergast at the end of the season, Al Davis just knew  he needed to retain the services of the great defensive mind that  produced the terrific defense of the Chiefs last season and the  Cardinals the previous 5 seasons before that. I guess when you're the  Raiders, you'll try anything. Hiring from winning programs is apparently  Davis' thing, he of course knew Tom Cable broke into coaching at San  Diego State University, a program world renowned for its football  excellence. Saints head coach Sean Payton was also on that SDSU staff  with Cable. Oops. Hired the wrong Aztec.
Finally, if you ever had the need to know what Snoop Doggy Dogg had  to say about the Raiders, today  is your day. So what do you think San Diego? Will Cable stick  around? Will the Raiders kick a lot of field goals next season? Will the  Raiders after lose less than 11 games? Will Al Davis be taken away by  the Sunset Squad Robots? Sound off in the comments below!
