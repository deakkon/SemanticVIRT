                    Danny DeVito's 'Troll Foot'STORY HIGHLIGHTS Danny DeVito takes pictures of his &quot;Troll Foot,&quot; then tweets about them  Foot has been pictured at Empire State Building, being licked by kitten  DeVito does Troll Foot for laughs; he maintains a sense of &quot;abandon&quot;  New York (CNN) -- Danny DeVito isn't shy about showing his feet to the world.  The actor/director has made a hobby of snapping pictures of his &quot;Troll Foot&quot; and tweeting them. Or, for anyone who is not well versed in Twitter: He posts the foot photos online for all to see.  &quot;Troll Foot,&quot; or &quot;TF&quot; as it is known, is becoming a catalyst to catalogue DeVito's journeys, and it's clearly an enjoyable endeavor for the funnyman. There are pictures of his &quot;Troll Foot&quot; being licked by a kitten, traveling through Italy, in the Empire State Building's shadow, and -- in one shot -- even draped in a slice of prosciutto.  Does DeVito ever get pedicures? &quot;No, I never get pedicures,&quot; he replied, tweeting his latest foot shot taken on Anderson Cooper's desk.

Troll Foot, said DeVito, &quot;was born out of an impulse for me to have a secret identity. That impulse lasted a second. Obvious history.&quot; But TF is making history, one small step at a time, because millions of DeVito fans are also enamored by his foot.  No doubt that fan base began a long time ago when DeVito started acting. He may be best known for his memorable portrayal of Louie De Palma, the caged dispatcher on the network television series &quot;Taxi.&quot; He's also starred in the films &quot;Romancing the Stone,&quot; &quot;Ruthless People&quot; (in which he delivered a particularly hilarious line to a wrong number) and &quot;Batman Returns.&quot;   DeVito and his wife, actress Rhea Perlman, can also take credit for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Garden State,&quot; which came out of their production company Jersey Films. Along with publicly playing footsie, DeVito has also been playing Frank Reynolds on the FX network program &quot;It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia&quot; since 2006. (The casts of &quot;Sunny&quot; and the Fox show &quot;Family Guy&quot; recently teamed up for a benefit to raise money for Haiti.) DeVito's proud of &quot;Sunny's&quot; outrageous comedy, and his role in it.  &quot;If you look at the Christmas DVD of 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' ... I'm naked in that show,&quot; DeVito proudly shared. &quot;Where do you get that, that ...&quot; he's asked, haltingly. &quot;Abandon?&quot; DeVito offered. It's all about comfort, he said. &quot;You have to be secure with yourself.&quot; Which is why Troll Foot, and the man it belongs to, isn't done leaving an imprint.
