Waco, Texas - The same jury that convicted Matt Baker of murder sentenced him to 65 years in prison with no fine. The jurors deliberated for about two hours. Judge Ralph Strother asked Baker if he had anything to say after the jury foreperson announced his sentence. Baker said, “I truly believe in my innocence. I believe the jury made a mistake in this.”
Baker will be eligible for parole when he is approximately 70 years old.  Under Texas law, he must serve half of his sentence or 30 years (whichever is less) before he can become parole eligible.
The judge also dismissed Baker&#039;s attorneys, Guy James Gray and Harold Danford, at their request. Court-appointed appellate attorney Gary Schwieger filed a notice of appeal on January 26, 2010 on behalf of Baker.
On February 22, 2010, Schwieger also filed a motion for a new trial, writing that Gray and Danford were ineffective trial counsel because they failed to:
• “adequately communicate with Baker prior to the trial”
• call or consult with “any experts in the fields of forensic pathology or toxicology” to the stand
• “adequately investigate the case”
• “adequately cross-examine witnesses”, including his former mistress Vanessa Bulls
• “act in a representative capacity for and/or demonstrated a lack of loyalty” to Baker during and after the trial
The motion for a new trial will be heard on April 1, 2010.
