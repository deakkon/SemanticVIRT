		Heidi Montag has reached the legal limit on breast implants	
			
Heidi Montag appeared as a guest on Jay Leno&#039;s &#034;Tonight Show&#034; Friday, and although Leno tried to keep the conversation on her career, he couldn&#039;t ignore the silicone elephant in the room. 
As the conversation inevitably steered towards her recent 10 plastic surgeries, Leno asked if there was anything else she&#039;d change.
Montag - who doesn&#039;t think she&#039;s addicted to plastic surgery since an addiction &#034;is something you do every day&#034; - said there are still two things she&#039;d augment if the law allowed. 

&#034;I would get [my breasts] bigger, but I legally can’t right now,&#034; she said. &#034;There&#039;s a limit - 800 cc - and I have 700.&#034;
For the time being though, Montag said she&#039;s reached a stopping point. &#034;I think I&#039;m surgery-ed out,&#034; she said.
Montag, who will be in recovery for a year, has been able to use her high-profile procedures to land an acting job without even having to audition. She&#039;ll appear in the upcoming comedy, &#034;Just Go With It,&#034; starring Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler.
&#034;They just called me and said ‘we’d love to have you,&#039;&#034; she said. &#034;Kevin Nealson [plays] my husband, and he’s had more surgery than I have in the movie, so we kept playing around with who has more injections.&#034;
