  So, Iowa at Purdue. Whenever a game's line is 19.5 points (and, had we known about this, we would have instructed you to bet at least one eyeball on Purdue), there's a very good chance that it's going to become a laugher. That's exactly what happened. The final score was&nbsp;63-40, and the man of the match was Jarryd Cole, who played 14 minutes before fouling out in a Brommerian blaze of glory. Or whatever the opposite of glory is. Anyway, Cole had 10 points in those 14 minutes, and when the rest of the team scores 30 in 186 unwatchable minutes of play, 10 points by one guy looks awfully good.
There isn't much point in trying to suss out what went right or wrong--short version, everything for Purdue right, everything for Iowa wrong--but we'll just point to two instances in the game, one from each half.
First half: Iowa had given up seven straight points, but hit a three-pointer and forced two turnovers; the score is 23-15 after an Eric May rebound. Purdue has now failed to score on four straight possessions. On offense, the ball has been moved around effectively on this possession, and a pass finds itself in the hands of Devan Bawinkel, who is open for a quick shot. Bawinkel demurs, passing to Eric May at the top of the key instead. Pressured, May dribbles inside the arc and hoists a harmless, ineffectual 20-footer. Clank. Purdue grabs the rebound, and before Iowa can so much as attempt another shot, it's 30-15, Purdue. Iowa would not score a point for the rest of the half.
Second half: Iowa has somewhat climbed back into the game; the 19-point halftime lead has been cut to 11 (39-28), and Iowa has the ball. Brennan Cougill, who has just converted his trademark Pick and Popsicle, attempts another such three-pointer to cut the lead to eight. It rims out, and Chris Kramer hits a three moments later. Iowa would not score again for more than six minutes of gameplay as Purdue runs off 10 straight. At this point, the game is effectively over, as Iowa would not get within 17 points for the rest of the game.
The game was so disheartening that I didn't even have the desire to drink the frustration away; I instead curled up for a nap. It lasted a while, and in it I hada wonderful dream about BHGP. I'd like to share that with all of you, because it sure as shit beats talking about this basketball game.
In our dream that takes place at an indeterminate time, we are watching ESPN or something. In the discussions of an indeterminate NFL game for which BHGP had an open thread, John Madden is offering his thoughts on the game and somebody asks him about the internet. Madden is casually dismissive of said Internet, but says that he's fond of one website, OUR WEBSITE, because we "sent him some pens."*
They then flashed our URL on the screen as such: http://www.blackhearts.com/football/goldpants.htm
That, of course, is not at all our website. BUT, as it turns out, that was a Hawkeye-themed message board that was run by, get this,&nbsp;an ex-girlfriend of&nbsp;Hawkeye State's. Naturally. It's where we had gotten the idea for our name, according to my poor, sleep-addled brain, and now we needed to get her to link to BHGP so we could get some of that wonderful ESPN traffic.
Then I woke up, angry at Hawkeye State for breaking so many hearts over the years. That mythical message board lady loved you, you know.
And also, the moral of the story is clearly this: WE NEED TO START SENDING PENS TO JOHN MADDEN. Get on it, people! There's no clearer path to his heart than with a well-placed ballpoint. Wait, that sounds wrong and violent. Don't stab him. You know what I mean.
*In retrospect, this comment&nbsp;is probably what made me think of pens. Fortunately, I connected none of the innuendo to Madden in my dream, and that's for the best.

      Versus Purdue
    
    
      The team was so flat.  It appeared, from my untrained eye, that the whole squad was just devastated that Tucker left.  As if they thought help was finally coming when he was reinstated, only to have the rug pulled out from underneath them.  Gatens was the worst (May and C-Payne, the ever-optimistic Froshes, didn&#8217;t quite seem as bad), but everybody played down today.
I read through the last line of posts, and I don&#8217;t see a mass exodus again this offseason.  I may see Brommer leaving (big fucking deal), but not Fuller, not Cougill, and certainly not anybody else.  To me, I&#8217;m still holding out hope that new blood arrives next year to influx into this year&#8217;s starting 5, and the team makes good strides next year.  Tucker was the exception to the rule.
If I&#8217;m wrong, though&#8230;..man.  What a waste of the last 5 years of Hawkeye basketball.  Seriously.  I hated Alford &#8212; hated him as a person, as a coach, as a developer of talent.  And I blame TL&#8217;s first 2 years entirely on Alford&#8217;s inability to recruit talent.  But if TL can&#8217;t get his own players to stick around, it&#8217;s time to move on.  Which means another 3 years of misery before something changes.  And that&#8217;s depressing.  I hope it&#8217;s not true.

      Yeah, the team was flat.
    
    
      However, I really hope they are not letting Tucker&#8217;s departure depress them that much.
This Purdue game was one we were supposed to lose, and lose bad.  And that&#8217;s what we did.  I don&#8217;t see a ton of shame in losing this way to a national top ten team on their home floor.
We have two more games in Carver (Michigan, and Indiana) and three more road games (at jNW, Wisky, and Minnesota).  All I want to see is for us to be competitive in three of those games, and maybe win one or two of them.  If we can&#8217;t win at least one, then they can fire Lick for all I care.
As for next year, I was just talking about that with a friend of mine after the win against jNW the other night.  I think that a best-case scenario for next year is close to what you said:  the new blood supplements the current players to the point that we can approach .500 in the conference and make an NIT.
If they fire Lick, does the new class stay committed to Iowa?  Do the current players stay around?  I can&#8217;t guarantee that those things would happen, so I bet that they keep Lick even if they lose the last 5 games this year.

      I think there's enough idle speculation in this thread as is.
    
    
      You phrased the question in terms of whether or not the incoming recruits would stay committed to Iowa &#8212; my response was just pointing out that it&#8217;s not fully their choice anymore.

      conventional wisdom says they would be more likely to stay if Lickliter gets fired. (And honestly, we don&#8217;t have any good players, so losing them wouldn&#8217;t hurt that much if we hire a good coach)

      I'm not calling for, but, I wouldn't be surprised if TL is fired at season's end
    
    
      Yes, there&#8217;s been improvement. But I think you have to look at it compared to what we&#8217;re doing in football and in wrestling. Basketball should be a revenue sport&#8230; but with empty stands, its not going to be.
If there is another mass exodus I think he&#8217;s in a very precarious position.
I also believe that we would be able to attract a quality coach. Its not exactly a crap job at a crap school&#8230;

      Indeed.  There has to be an assistant coach from a good program that would love to come to a B10 school.

      Firing Lickliter now doesn't help the "not crap" part. 
    
    
      To go from COTY to fired in three years would normally involve gross misconduct. There&#8217;s been none of that with Lickliter. He&#8217;s got to have another year.

      Gross misconduct
    
    
      I agree with you, but if there&#8217;s ANOTHER mass exodus of players after this year, somebody&#8217;s got to start asking why that&#8217;s happening.  Bad teams exist everywhere without losing 2-3 players out of the rotation each offseason, so if it happens again, don&#8217;t we have to start asking what is wrong on the inside?
I&#8217;m all for TL getting another year (I&#8217;d actually give him two; let next year&#8217;s &#8220;top 40&#8221; class get to be Sophomores before we judge too much), but there&#8217;s got to be a limit of players leaving.  Has to be.

      Okay, but there's no indication of another mass exodus coming.
    
    
      Tucker&#8217;s leaving, and Brommer might leave, but everyone else should be coming back. So while you&#8217;re not wrong, it&#8217;s like saying, &#8220;If Todd strangles a puppy at midcourt during a 2-point game with 5 seconds left and the technical puts the game out of reach, HE HAS TO GO.&#8221; Like, yes, but that&#8217;s probably not going to happen.

      Actually, that puppy-strangling...
    
    
      might just be the sizzle our program needs.
Maybe wait until we are at Wisconsin, and have him swing a dead badger in a noose while running a figure 8 at mid-court.
CRAZY INTENSITY!

      I don't think another one's coming either
    
    
      My only point was, that if Tucker&#8217;s leaving is an indication of more things to come (e.g. Brommer and Fuller follow him out the door), then we need to rethink.
And if he strangles a fucking poodle puppy, I say we give him an extension.  &#8217;cuz those little rats are UGLY.

      I agree...the team looks demoralized
    
    
      Basketball teams cultivate team morale very diffferent than do football teams. Football teams have waves of leadership, starting with the head coach, then position coach, then a player or two within that unit. You also have captains that have an overarching influence on the teams morale. Getting all of them to line up in a single purpose with shared values and goals is the challenge of a great football coach. Ferentz has mastered it. He understands that the players have to be a part of it or it won&#8217;t work, because Ferentz cannot connect equally with all the players.
Basketball allows for the head coach to be very hands on. 12 players, that&#8217;s it. So it is easy to give quality time to all of them. Yet, I cannot help but see a team that seems diffident and tired and disconnected from its coach. Which is VERY troubling. Again, and I have to stop saying it because I am tired of saying it, Lickliter looks lost as a leader. He looks whiny, he looks tired, he looks unprepared for postgame comments, he is not a very strong presence on campus (ala Brands and Ferentz), and he looks as if he is unable to put pieces together.
Someone esle mentioned Dr. Tom&#8217;s ability to put players together with seemingly incompatible skill sets. Whereas Lickliter burns through players who do not conform to his system. Well, this isn&#8217;t Kansas or Kentucky. Our cup does not runneth over. These players are recruited and they evolve as they evolve and a good coach will find a way to make use of their individual talents and move the process forward.
This Tucker thing is yet another example to me that Lickliter doesn&#8217;t understand the culture of his basketball program. The delicate balance and interconnectedness within a team, often referred to as chemistry. I see NO player emerging as a leader. I instead see Lickliter&#8217;s obsession with selflessness leading to a group of players who look around at crunch time for someone to lead&#8212;and no one ever steps up. And that falls on Lickliter because he has turned this team into a sort of 1970s Soviet citizenry. It&#8217;s getting sad and I am losing my faith in the man&#8217;s ability to lead.

      Regarding leaders.
    
    
      I think Cole, May, Gatens, Payne, and Fuller are all leading in the way they know how:  by example.  They are busting their butts.  They are not going to point fingers or call out teammates.  They are not going to hog the ball.
It may seem like a problem to have so few vocal people, and so few people who can demand the rock and go for 25 points when we need it.  I would argue that even Tucker might not have had that skill (I don&#8217;t really recall him going for 20+ in games that mattered).
I always claim that Lick needs to develop more of a personality with the media.  Maybe this is the time to do that with his players.  Tell a few jokes.  Let the team loose a bit.  Nothing really matters at this point, so have some fun.

      My reaction to the coach developing improved media relations with press that are poodles anyway.
    
    
      Sorry, Chazz, nothing personal, but seriously.  The team needs better press relations?
http://23.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kvhkvwh5GB1qzf94so1_400.gif
So here we are, fellas, you got alcoholic teenager-type guys announcing mid-season that they&#8217;re quitting and what, 40% attrition last year?  And this business about the team being young: uh, college basketball is played by freshmen these days?  What, they need three years of misery lessons before they are qualified to pick-and-roll a center so&#8217;s he can launch 25-footers off a back foot?
Anyway, the big mystery for me is how Iowa can fail to out-recruit UNI or Butler.  All the talk about our inferior basketball facility is fine; so it&#8217;s better up at Cedar Falls?
One point per minute in a D-I college basketball game?  15 points in a half?  Lowest scoring effort since 1949?  (They were shooting set shots in 1949.)   Does Denise Long have any D-I men&#8217;s eligibility left?   The Warriors drafted her, you know.

I&#8217;d rather lose by 35, 105-80, than watch this effort to squeeze the fucking life out of the ball.
I think 3000 people a game is very doable next year.  Any reason why it would improve?  Any reason why people might say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I want to watch 40 ppg basketball this year.&#8221;
There&#8217;s a screw loose here.
The horror.  The horror.

      McLeod Center at UNI opened in 2006
    
    
      and while it certainly isn&#8217;t bigger then CHA, it is a outstanding facility for the Missouri Valley.  So yeah, it&#8217;s better in Cedar Falls.  And not to go all Eddie-Munster-Hair-Gel-Hoosier-Dbag-throwplayersunderthebus-Alford on you, the game has changed in regards to the impact of these basketball condo&#8217;s on recruiting.  Realize that besides classes and sleep, they spend the rest of the time at these facilities (editor note: does not include Tucker, Pierce, and Ray Thompson&#8230;yup, I went Ray Thompson on you&#8230;interesting story, I saw Wade Lackingskills take a round house right fist from Ray.  Wade was drunk on Russian vodka and started ragging on Ray, &#8220;you let us down Ray, you let us down.&#8221;  Now imagine him slurring it 100 times at 1:00 am and I ask you, what black man surrounded by his posse wouldn&#8217;t take the opportunity to beat the shit out of him?  The Skinners jumped in to break it up but the damage was done.  Wade&#8217;s nose = FAIL, blood everywhere&#8230;.of all times not to be in the triple threat position Wade.) Sorry,  I digress.
The Butler Way needs to be ammended and we need to bring some JuCo&#8217;s in and let them loose running the pick and roll.  I&#8217;m totally with Bellanca on watching a 105-80 loss than this crap.  Well better get back to pairs figure skatinzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, zzzzzz, zzzzzz

      Offensive Game Plan
    
    
      Although 40 points is a new low, this is the sixth time this team has scored 50 or less this season.  If you removed all coaching and told this bunch to just &#8220;go playground&#8221; they would score more points than this.  And to think, they were actually following an offensive game plan enroute to these 40 points.  I am a Hawk through and through but this is like being waterboarded for weeks on end.  I am looking forward to track season.

      we are hitting historical lows. At what point does Lickliter take responsbility for this outcome. Also, Iowa can never hire a coach from a non-BCC school EVER again. This Missouri State, Butler shit is over. I don&#8217;t want UNi&#8217;s coach either. I&#8217;ll take an assistant who has NEVER been a head coach, as long as he is from a big time basketball school. Watching these small minded, small conference coaches try to swiim with the sharks is depressing.

      Iowa is the school that gets the second tier of these guys. So I perfer second tier from the big time, not the small time.

      He probably would have had we offered him the job out of UW-M
    
    
      His point was that saying that guys from mid-majors don&#8217;t work out is ridiculous because there are lots of examples, like Pearl, of guys who have moved up to a bigger conference and had success.
And as for us only getting second tier guys, Todd Lickliter had just won National Coach of the Year when we hired him, he was hardly a second-tier mid-major coach.

      I&#8217;ve been about as critical of him as anyone here, for the most part.  I&#8217;m saying that he was a well respected coach at the time we hired him.  I&#8217;m sure he would have gotten another big job soon if we hadn&#8217;t hired him.

      Maybe.  
    
    
      I&#8217;m trying to think of jobs (probably in the midwest or the northeast) that have come open that he might have jumped at.  Would Minnesota have lured him instead of Tubby, or did they get Tubby before we got Lick?  Would a Big 12 program have pursued him?
Really, Iowa should have been a pretty good fit for him.  It just didn&#8217;t help that nearly every other Big Ten school in the second tier decided to improve at the exact same time, (although Indiana has declined).

      Regarding [name redacted].
    
    
      I watched a good portion of the New Mexico at Utah game last night.
HairGel is getting his results with a smallish, athletic team that can run or can try to play the half-court game (they didn&#8217;t appear great at the half-court).
I was struck by how similar to Iowa they were, although they were more athletic and they are playing in a weaker conference.
I don&#8217;t want HairGel back, and I would like to see Lick start an ascension to the top of the Big Ten soon.  However, I think SlickSteve would have had this Iowa team at at least 4 more wins right now (albeit, maybe only one of them a Big Ten victory).

      That's a seriously strange and daunting recap.
    
    
      But, I have a strange and daunting impulse to check in on this basketball team a few times a week, and see if things could possibly become worse.  And I&#8217;m rarely frustrated.
Do you think we&#8217;ll score in the 20&#8217;s sometime this year, for a full game?

      During what now is refered to as the Iowa basketball post season, the first round (only round) of the Big Ten + Iowa Tournament.   Against the #1 seed I can see 100-29.

      That's not how it works, though
    
    
      First of all, y&#8217;all are forgetting that Iowa is not last in the Big Ten.  Penn State is 0-12 in conference play, and will almost certainly be the 11 seed at the Big Ten Tournament.  Also, Iowa has as many conference wins as Indiana (currently one more loss), and therefore is actually challenging for the 9th seed.
Regardless of all that, since 11 teams don&#8217;t fit perfectly into a bracket, the top 5 seeds all get first-round byes.  The Thursday games are 8/9, 7/10, and 6/11.  I see that rcpratt just posted while I was typing, but to take his comment further, Iowa wouldn&#8217;t play the 1 seed unless it finishes ahead of Indiana AND wins the first round game.  If the season ended right now, Iowa would be the 10 seed, and play 7 seed just Northwestern.  Beat them again, and the Friday game would be against 3 seed Purdue.

      Also, the current 1 seed would be Michigan State
    
    
      And you may recall final scores of 71-53 and 70-63 earlier this season.  Not great, but not 100-29.

      You're right
    
    
      Which might actually be Purdue right now.  Ohio State, Purdue, and Illinois are all at 9-3 in conference&#8212;ESPN lists them in that order in the standings, but Purdue has the best overall record.  Not sure what the tiebreaker is for Big Ten Tournament seeding.

      The first tiebreaker is head to head winning percentage for both a 2 team tie and a multiple team tie. The next tiebreaker is a bit odd, since it is the teams&#8217; record against the 2nd place team. So, for example, if Purdue, Michigan State, and Wisconsin end up tied for the regular season title and Illinois is the lone 4th place team, then the tiebreaker is their record against Illinois. The third tiebreaker is the winning percentage of all Division 1 opponents a team has faced, and the fourth tiebreaker is a good old fashioned coin toss.

      Think it goes with record all the way down the standings
    
    
      So if teams are tied for third, record against first place (or the first two if those two are tied) is the second tiebreaker, then record against second (if not tied with first), then record against whatever team or teams immediately trail them, and so on all the way down to record against Penn State.
But based on that, at the moment: OSU is now in first (haven&#8217;t played MSU yet, beat Purdue, MSU lost to Purdue), MSU second, Purdue third, Illinois fourth (head-to-head over Wisconsin), Wisconsin fifth.

      Lick is going to a gun fight with your Uncle Sals rusty, old multi-utinsel knife.
    
    
      Let me say that I thought that Lick was the right hire in 2006.  National Coach of the Year, good with the media, self-depricating humour&#8230;.good guy to represent the state.  But unless we had gotten Pitino, Caliparri, Coack K, Roy Williams to coach at Iowa, no one was going to be successful immediately at Iowa due to two reasons; the lack of talent that Eddie Munster left and more importantly, the biggest joke of a basketball facility in the midwest.
Key words: basketball facility.  CHA with 15K in attendance is a true home court advantage, I love that arena.  But the rest is a joke.  How can we hold any coach accountable for recruiting when other schools facilities have state of the art bells and whistles that include basketball only practice courts, study rooms, cafeterias, lounges, video rooms, excercise rooms, training rooms, recruiting rooms.  And not having to share most of these perks with wrestling, volleyball, womens basketball!  You know, like what our football program now has.  The Jacobson building and the Kinnick renovations are as much a part to the success of Iowa football in the aughts as our 8-toed defensive coordinator&#8230;..
The expansion of CHA is 10 years late.  We all love our Hawks, we love Iowa City, and know that you can have a consistent 20 win season teams here.  But it won&#8217;t happen when other coaches in the big ten can say about Hawkeye basketball, &#8220;You know, Joe Recruit, Iowa has to schedule practice time around wrestling, volleyball, and womens basketball, including their other support/training facilities.  Now, let me show you around our state of the art facility.&#8221;
I don&#8217;t see things getting better.  I don&#8217;t see us making the NCAA&#8217;s in the next two years.  As we improve, so will the rest of the league.  I think Lick should get another year but then Barta has to ask if too much damage has been done to Lick&#8217;s reputation for him to warrant an extension.  Good guy, but not enough talent to run his style of offense against Big Ten competition.  Don&#8217;t even get me started with the pick and roll offense that produces only 3-point shots.
The scary thing is that if we had the CHA expansion done 10 years ago, Steve Alford would probably be in his 3rd year as Indiana&#8217;s head coach.

      But I&#8217;m watching the Iowa women right now (leading Illinois 31-6!!!), and the crowd is bigger than most of the mens games this year.
If Lickliter comes back next year, it will be inconceivebly empty in carver next year. The wrestling team already outdraws them, and next year the women(who are constantly improving[amazing concept, I know]) will outdraw them as well.

      Women's attendance...
    
    
      for the last three home games is listed as:  Mich St was 2800+ , Purdue was 7700+ , jNW was 3700+.
If we knew what the actual attendance for mens&#8217; games was, I could make a comparison.
      
        I've sentenced boys younger than you to the gas chamber. Didn't want to do it. I felt I owed it to them.

      Are you kidding?
    
    
      The mens actual attendance this year is under 5000 per game!

You can&#8217;t actually think it will go up next year. There are a lot of people who got season tickets that won&#8217;t be renewing(me included). Next year it will probably be closer to 3,000 than 5000 per game. The women will be damn close, considering they will be contending for the Big Ten title.
