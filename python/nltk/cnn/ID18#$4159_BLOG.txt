A Cleveland jury convicted Essa last week of aggravated murder for poisoning Rosemarie Essa, his wife and the mother of his two children, with a calcium pill laced with cyanide.
Essa, 41, will be eligible for parole in 20 years, Cuyahoga County prosecutor Bill Mason said. His crime occurred before Ohio sentencing laws were changed to give judges discretion in determining when a convicted murderer is eligible for parole.
The six-week trial included testimony from more than 60 witnesses who told the story of a philandering doctor, his many mistresses and an international manhunt that crossed three continents and ended with his arrest in Cyprus in October 2006, 18 months after his wife&#039;s death.
