Tassos Papadopoulos

 (CNN) -- Police in Cyprus said Tuesday they have found the body of former President Tassos Papadopoulos, which was stolen from his grave late last year. Police said they found the body at a Nicosia cemetery Monday night following an anonymous tip. They went with members of the late president's family, who identified evidence. &quot;There has been identification through the means of DNA and it was confirmed that the corpse belongs to the former president,&quot; a police spokesman told CNN. The spokesman could not be named in line with policy. Papadopoulos' body went missing from his grave in a cemetery in Deftera, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) outside of Nicosia, on the eve of the first anniversary of his death in December. Police interrogated suspects but have not arrested anyone in the case, the police spokesman told CNN. The family planned to make a statement Tuesday morning, and the police were expected to release more information later in the day, the state-run Cyprus News Agency reported.
