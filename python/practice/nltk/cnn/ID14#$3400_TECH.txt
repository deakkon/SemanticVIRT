 (CNN) -- &quot;It has been a long road. To be at the finish line is great.&quot; So says developer Stig Asmussen, who has just put the final touches on what has been called the most eagerly awaited video game of 2010: the fantastic action-adventure sequel &quot;God of War III.&quot; The game, coming March 16 for Sony's PlayStation 3 console, is the culmination of nine years of work for director Asmussen and the rest of Sony's creative team for the &quot;God of War&quot; series. High-profile games rarely live up to massive hype, but early reports on &quot;God of War III&quot; -- in which gamers battle gods from Greek mythology -- have been glowing. &quot; 'God of War III' is expected to deliver the most bombastic, over-the-top action-adventure game ever,&quot; said video game analyst Scott Steinberg, author of &quot;Get Rich Playing Games.&quot; &quot;The demo was phenomenal. This has never been a series known for a light touch.&quot; A description of the forthcoming game on PlayStation's site even promises &quot;new heightened levels of brutality and gore.&quot; Hollywood also is considering a movie adaptation of the series -- which Sony says has sold over 8.7 million copies worldwide -- although no project is imminent. The &quot;God of War&quot; series debuted in 2005 and follows the exploits of a former Spartan warrior named Kratos as he seeks revenge against Ares, Zeus and other Greek gods who wronged him. The 2007 &quot;God of War II&quot; ends with Kratos enlisting the aid of the legendary Titans in his quest. The popularity of the first two games (not counting two lesser &quot;God of War&quot; titles), plus the fact that that &quot;GOW III&quot; is expected to be the end of the series, has fans clamoring for this final chapter. At last year's Spike Video Game Awards, &quot;God of War III&quot; was named Most Anticipated Game of 2010. Some observers even wonder whether &quot;GOW III&quot; can top the all-time fastest-selling PS3 exclusive game, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots,&quot; which sold a whopping 1.7 million units in its opening week in 2008. Demo and gameplay videos reveal that &quot;GOW III&quot; is expected to pick up where &quot;GOW II&quot; left off -- with a massive assault on the gods' stronghold of Mount Olympus. The ambitious scale shown in previews is what Asmussen had hoped to achieve when he took over the &quot;God of War&quot; franchise. Sony hired Asmussen away from Midway Games in 2001 to work as the lead environmental artist on the series.  &quot;I built a number of the major levels of 'God of War' and worked on the early designs,&quot; said Asmussen, who drew on his previous experiences to help him achieve his vision for &quot;God of War III.&quot; Asmussen said they never originally intended to make a trilogy but realized they had a hot property on their hands after the original &quot;God of War&quot; won the Game of Show award at the E3 gaming conference. They immediately jumped into working on &quot;God of War II.&quot;  Working with director Cory Barlog on &quot;God of War II&quot; helped give Asmussen a greater understanding of all the skills needed to put together a blockbuster title -- skills that would be put to the test after he was named game director for &quot;God of War III,&quot; he said. He said work on &quot;GOW III&quot; began while developers at Sony's studios in Santa Monica, California, were still working on &quot;GOW II.&quot; A small group of designers and developers began testing the limits of a new console: the PlayStation 3. &quot;First, it kind of scared the crap out of us,&quot; Asmussen said of the PS3, which hit stores in 2006. &quot;We knew the expectations were going to be high.&quot; When production on &quot;GOW III&quot; began in 2007, Asmussen was given a script outline with major points on characters and locations, but it was missing a true narrative to tie it all together.  &quot;I needed to really understand [the script], and the best way to do that is fashion it into something that fits my vision,&quot; he said. &quot;I created a new plot ... [with] a lot of the locations and characters, but used them differently.&quot; Asmussen believes the PlayStation 3 system gave his team the opportunity to take the game to a more sophisticated level.  He cited one particular sequence where Kratos is battling a horde of enemies on the back of a Titan, which is  talking to him while climbing up a mountainside. It is something they could have never done on the PlayStation 2, he said. &quot;This is going to be a generational-defining game using this technology. Others are going to see what we did and realize they can use the PS3 like that as well,&quot; he told CNN.  There are more weapons available to Kratos than in &quot;GOW II,&quot; and they are accessed on the fly instead of through a power-up menu. Steinberg, the video game analyst, has demoed &quot;God of War III&quot; and said the gameplay is fast and furious. He described it as &quot;heavy metal meets Greek tragedy.&quot; Steinberg believes games like &quot;GOW III&quot; and &quot;BioShock 2&quot; raise the excitement level for hard-core gaming by making games that involve more than just bloody button-mashing. &quot;'GOW III' is as much about storytelling and atmosphere as it is whacking away until horns, tusks and arms go flying,&quot; he said. Asmussen said there will be no &quot;God of War IV,&quot; no matter how well the third chapter does. But the lessons learned with &quot;GOW III&quot; will be used to make other titles enjoyable for future players. &quot;We think about the fans all the time,&quot; he said. &quot;We have an enormous amount of pride here. We won't accept failure.&quot;
