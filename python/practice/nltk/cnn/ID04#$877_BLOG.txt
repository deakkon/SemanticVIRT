A month-long search of a Texas landfill has ended with no signs of 8-month-old Gabriel Johnson, police said Friday.
“This case leaves us with somewhat of a bittersweet conclusion,” said William McManus, chief of the San Antonio Police Department. “The good news is we have no homicide. The bad news is the case is still open.”
McManus said the landfill search, in which 7,620 tons of debris were removed, is now over.
“We found no evidence of a homicide,” he said. He urged anyone with information about the child’s whereabouts to call 1-800-THE LOST.
Gabriel has been missing since December 26 and was last seen in San Antonio, with his 23-year-old mother, Elizabeth Johnson, who has refused to disclose information on his whereabouts.
