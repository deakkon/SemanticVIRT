 (CNN) -- The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced Tuesday that &quot;Hurt Locker&quot; producer Nicolas Chartier will not be allowed to attend the March 7 awards show because of an e-mail that has been deemed in violation of the Academy's campaigning standards. &quot;Chartier had recently disseminated an e-mail to certain Academy voters and other film industry figures in which he solicited votes for his own picture and disparaged one of the other contending films,&quot; the Academy said in a statement Tuesday evening. According to the Los Angeles Times, Chartier's e-mail asked the message recipients to spread the word about the Iraq war movie so that the independent feature would win, &quot;and not a $500M film,&quot; which many have interpreted as a slight against James Cameron's box-office blockbuster &quot;Avatar.&quot; To the Academy, Chartier's appeal to voters and industry insiders crossed the line by &quot;casting a negative or derogatory light on a competing film,&quot; which, according to the Academy's statement, is against the organization's rules.

Late Monday, the Academy decided that it would rescind only Chartier's invitation, &quot;stopping short&quot; of pulling &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; out of the running altogether. If the film wins, remaining producers Kathryn Bigelow, Mark Boal and Greg Shapiro will accept the award. Chartier would receive his Oscar statuette later.
