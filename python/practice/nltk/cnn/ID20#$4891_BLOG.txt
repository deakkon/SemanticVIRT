		Is Lady Gaga&#039;s &#039;Telephone&#039; video socially irresponsible?	
			
Lady Gaga&#039;s nine-minute music video for her single &#034;Telephone&#034; has been described as &#034;epic,&#034; but R&amp;B singer India.Arie counts herself among those who aren&#039;t as impressed.
The &#034;Video&#034; songstress tweeted on March 18 that she found Gaga&#039;s video, with a cameo by Beyonce, to be &#034;socially irresponsible.&#034;
&#034;Don&#039;t be offended, this is all MY opinion,&#034; Arie tweeted. &#034;Am I the only one who thinks the &#039;Telephone&#039; video goes a bit too far?&#034;

For Arie, the imagery - and the message those images may send - is questionable.
&#034;I agree Gaga&#039;s being her image...I dig her creative mind. But still...there&#039;s such a thing as being socially irresponsible,&#034; she said. &#034;There&#039;s an artist every 10 years who pushes the envelope...but its bout to fall off the Table. When is it too far?&#034;
To be clear, it&#039;s not the nudity that irks Arie - it&#039;s the nudity being used for shock value, she said.
&#034;Crazy to me that the dark, underbelly, shock at all cost thing is a TREND like asymetrical hair and big shoulder jackets. Slippery slope!&#034;
Arie&#039;s words have been a slippery slope of their own, as they have led to a backlash. Arie re-tweeted one Twitter user&#039;s response to her thoughts, which read, &#034;[expletive] shut the [expletive] up! Your a [expletive] hater! Kuz yo [expletive] will always be a #Flop.&#034;
Arie posted a lengthy response yesterday, attempting to clarify what she meant by her statements.
&#034;The conversation I initiated isn&#039;t about any ONE, BUT EVERYONE. THIS is a conversation about the state of our society and the state of human kind....a conversation about what we&#039;re willing to turn a blind eye to in the name of fitting in,&#034; Arie said.
She added that while she respects and admires both Beyonce and Lady Gaga, she doesn&#039;t believe that means she has to agree with what they do.
