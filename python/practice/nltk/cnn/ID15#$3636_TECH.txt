Branson's company Virgin Galactic announced Monday that the VSS Enterprise had successfully completed what it called a captive carry flight attached to a carrier plane. The spacecraft's developer called it a &quot;momentous day.&quot; &quot;The captive carry flight signifies the start of what we believe will be extremely exciting and successful spaceship flight test program,&quot; said Burt Rutan, founder of Scaled Composites, which built the spacecraft. The VSS Enterprise remained attached to its carrier aircraft for the duration of the 2-hour, 54-minute flight, reaching an altitude of 45,000 feet, according to a statement from Virgin.

Eventually, the 60-foot long rocket plane will be taken 60,000 feet above the Earth by its carrier and fire rockets to propel itself into space.  The test-flight program is expected to continue through 2011, going first to a free glide and then to a powered flight before commercial flights begin. &quot;Seeing the finished spaceship in December was a major day for us but watching VSS Enterprise fly for the first time really brings home what beautiful, ground-breaking vehicles Burt and his team have developed for us,&quot; Branson said. &quot;Today was another major step along that road and a testament to U.S. engineering and innovation,&quot; he said. Virgin Galactic has envisioned one flight a week, with six tourists aboard. Each will pay $200,000 for the ride and train for at least three days before going. About 80,000 people have placed their names on the waiting list for seats. &quot;What we want to be able to do is bring space travel down to a price range where hundreds of thousands of people would be able to experience space, and they never dreamed that [they] could,&quot; Branson said last year. He has said he hopes the technology will lead to a new form of Earth travel, jetting people across oceans and continents faster through suborbital routes.
