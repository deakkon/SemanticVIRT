Actress Reese Witherspoon is in Washington today to tackle some tough issues.



Washington (CNN) &#8211; Reese Witherspoon is getting serious.
Witherspoon told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday about her quest to stop violence against women around the world. She said she isn't alone in her fight.
"I think when you have strong powerful women standing up and speaking out about these issues, not to mention how many women represent us in the Senate and the House of Representatives, you're going to start to see a major change in these areas," stated the actress. 
The actress is in town to attend the 2010 International Women of Courage Awards along with First Lady Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  
Witherspoon is a representative of the Avon Foundation and is partnering with the non-profit group Vital Voices to shine a light on the difficult issues women face as a result of abuse. 
Watch the full interview at 6 p.m. EST on "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."
