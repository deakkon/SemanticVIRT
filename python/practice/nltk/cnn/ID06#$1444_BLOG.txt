		A call to wear black for Johnny Cash

Johnny Cash would have been 78 on Friday.
The Man in Black died in 2003. To the end, he was a voice of truth and humility, a connector of generations, a legend. (You can still hear that voice: His last album with producer Rick Rubin, the bare-bones &#034;American VI: Ain&#039;t No Grave,&#034; came out on Tuesday.)
In honor of the great man&#039;s birthday, the Cash family, Rubin and his American Recordings and Lost Highway Records are asking for a tribute: Wear Black for Cash.
In a press release, the group said, &#034;February 26th, 2010, is Johnny Cash’s 78th birthday, and to celebrate his life we’re encouraging everyone worldwide to wear black for Johnny on this day. ... [to] remember the man in black and the voice he gave the common man and &#039;the poor and beaten-down.&#039; &#034;
There will be a handful of events in conjunction with the birthday, which are detailed on this Facebook page.
Cash once had a hit with his song &#034;Man in Black,&#034; in which he detailed the reasons why he wears such dark clothes. For Johnny Cash, it might be worth doing the same.
