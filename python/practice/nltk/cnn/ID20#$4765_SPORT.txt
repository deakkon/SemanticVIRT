2010 NFL Mock Draft 2.0 (cont.)










&nbsp;











11

S
Eric Berry</a>
Tennessee</a>
Jr.
5-11
203




I have to believe the Jaguars would be thrilled to see this scenario unfold, given their need at safety. Berry has been considered a possible top five pick, but I sense some slippage potential with Texas safety Earl Thomas closing ground on him. If the Browns go for Haden at No. 7 and Denver can't pass on Bryant, Berry to Jacksonville could unfold.










12

DE-OLB
Sergio Kindle</a>
Texas</a>
Sr.
6-4
255




The Dolphins need linebacking help, and as a 3-4 outside linebacker with pass rush potential, Kindle is a more valuable commodity than Alabama inside linebacker Rolando McClain. Either way, Miami fills a need. Receiver is the other obvious spot to address, but with Bryant gone, no one else carries a high enough grade to justify being picked 12th.








13

S
Earl Thomas</a>
Texas</a>
So.
5-10
197




In our first mock, we had Thomas going to the 49ers at No. 16, but that was then and this is now. With none of the four highest-rated offensive tackles left on the board, getting a playmaking safety like Thomas will be job one for San Francisco. A strong combine showing will help Thomas continue to rise in this year's pre-draft scouting season, but the game film shows plenty. He can cover, has a nice nose for the ball and can dish out some punishment on run defense.










14

QB
Jimmy Clausen</a>
Notre Dame</a>
Jr.
6-3
223




(SEAHAWKS ACQUIRED PICK FROM BRONCOS)We admittedly don't know what Pete Carroll thinks of Clausen just yet, but we can't help but wonder if the Seahawks' new head coach will pick up the phone and give his good friend Charlie Weis a call to discuss the former Golden Domer. That could be a bit awkward, eh? With an offensive tackle secured at No. 6, and this draft deep in running backs, it makes sense for Seattle to spend its second first-rounder on Matt Hasselbeck's eventual replacement.








15

ILB
Rolando McClain</a>
Alabama</a>
Jr.
6-4
258




With veteran middle linebacker Antonio Pierce released, the Giants have a job just waiting for the polished McClain. New York's defensive line still needs more pass rush, so a talent like Georgia Tech's Derrick Morgan, USC's Everson Griffen, or Florida's Carlos Dunlap could be on the radar screen for the G-Men.








16*

G-OT
Mike Iupati</a>
Idaho</a>
Sr.
6-5
325





Having acquired their safety in Thomas at No. 13, the 49ers likely will turn their attention to their need at right offensive tackle. Iupati is a tough and talented prospect who played guard at Idaho, but he's got the size to handle the right tackle slot, and he strikes many as Mike Singletary's type of no-nonsense player.
*Panthers (who traded pick to 49ers) and Titans tied for this spot. A coin-flip will determine order.








17

DE
Derrick Morgan</a>
Georgia Tech</a>
Jr.
6-4
272




The Titans' defensive line needs an infusion of young talent, and with the expected departure of end Kyle Vanden Bosch via free agency, drafting help up front becomes a priority. The other first-round-worthy pass-rushing ends available are the aforementioned Everson Griffen of USC and Carlos Dunlap of Florida.









18

NT
Dan Williams</a>
Tennessee</a>
Sr.
6-2
329




This is a lot higher than the Steelers' usual draft slot neighborhood, but there's plenty to like about their new surroundings. Pittsburgh should have good choices at nose tackle and interior offensive line, its top two positions of need. The ex-Vol Williams gives them an eventual replacement for veteran nose tackle Casey Hampton, who, despite re-signing with the Steelers on Thursday, is a year-by-year proposition at this point in his career. On the offensive line, Florida center-guard Maurkice Pouncey is quite a name, and he's on the rise in this pre-draft season. 









19*

CB
Kyle Wilson</a>
Boise State</a>
Sr.
5-10
186





I'm sticking with Wilson to Atlanta, but he's by no means the consensus No. 2 cover corner. Others in the discussion: Rutgers' Devin McCourty, Alabama's Kareem Jackson and Florida State's Patrick Robinson. Someone will probably start to separate from the pack at this week's combine. Wilson is only 5-10, 190, but he has strong coverage skills and will battle you all day long.*Falcons and Texans tied for this spot. A 

coin-flip will determine order.








20

RB
C.J. Spiller</a>
Clemson</a>
Sr.
5-11
195




What a gift for the Texans' moribund running game if Spiller -- the draft's consensus top rusher -- lasts until Houston's turn comes up. How much better might the Texans' explosive passing game be if opposing defenses have to respect a running threat? Spiller is a versatile talent who can run, catch the ball out of the backfield and add some juice in the return game.
