Now it&#039;s Tony Kornheiser who has put his foot in his mouth.
The co-host of ESPN&#039;s &#034;Pardon the Interruption&#034; - known as much for his sarcastic jokes as his sports talk - turned his commentary to ESPN colleague Hannah Storm&#039;s outfit on his radio show last week.
According to The Sporting News, Kornheiser called a Storm outfit &#034;horrifying&#034; and described its fit on her as &#034;like she has sausage casing wrapping around her upper body.&#034;
Kornheiser later apologized, saying, &#034;I&#039;m a sarcastic, subversive guy ... I&#039;m a troll, look at me. I have no right to  insult what anybody looks like or what anybody wears.&#034;
But the damage had been done. Today, ESPN announced Kornheiser&#039;s been suspended temporarily. (UPDATE: USA Today reports Kornheiser&#039;s suspension is two weeks.)
What do you think? Did the penalty fit the crime?
