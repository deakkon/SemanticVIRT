			
It was pitched as David versus Goliath. The battle of the exes. Bigelow versus Cameron.
But whichever way you cut it, “The Hurt Locker” came out the winner of the Oscars gong fest with six statuettes to “Avatar’s” three.
Back in January this wasn&#039;t how things were expected to go. James Cameron’s blue-furred 800lb gorilla was the favorite to beat Kathryn Bigelow’s tense Iraq war drama &#8211; a deserved Oscar winner &#8211; thanks to &#034;Avatar&#039;s&#034; triumphs at the Golden Globes and all-round box-office supremacy.
Of course, previous awards seasons suggest that sci-fi and fantasy dramas never play well with Academy voters. It’s a fair point - but &#034;Avatar&#034; is a rule-breaker, both technically and commercially, that has lifted it above any genre. Those 11 Oscars given to Peter Jackson’s fantasy epic &#034;Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King&#034; back in 2003 counted for something.
So, if the Academy was okay with Middle Earth then why not Pandora?
“Avatar” began to lose ground in late February as bookmakers started cutting the odds on &#034;The Hurt Locker&#034; and seasoned movie observers began to question Cameron&#039;s chances. It helped Bigelow’s drama that it had been given the  top award by the Producer’s Guild of America. During the past 20 years the PGA has given its top prize to 14 films that then won the best picture Oscar. That’s not a 100 percent strike rate &#8211;but it would have influenced Academy voters.
And then there was the impact on the race of the, um, Winter Olympics. Sounds bizarre? Well ...
The Oscars were held two weeks later this year to avoid a domestic TV schedule clash with events in Vancouver. &#034;Why have two gigantic, spectacular events happen on the same day, particularly these days?” asked then Academy President Sid Ganis, announcing the date shuffle last year. Why indeed.
&#034;Avatar&#034; has enjoyed a high-profile awards campaign since its December release - but we’ve been living on Pandora for near three months straight now. After a while, even blue-skinned aliens lose their novelty value.
“The Hurt Locker” by contrast had its festival bow in fall 2008, then enjoyed a quiet domestic rollout last June, allowing it to be rediscovered by voters come awards season (see also how Paul Haggis’s “Crash” took best picture against Ang Lee’s “Brokeback Mountain” in 2006).
Did “Avatar’s” lead in the best picture race irrevocably slip away during those final two weeks? Would it have won had the voting papers been due 14 days earlier?
We can never know: the breakdown of the best picture ballot is kept secret, as is the rest of the Oscar voting. This year’s new 10-picture category also meant the race was likely tighter than usual (the new voting system, whereby voters ranked all 10 nominees, would have helped the better-reviewed &#034;Hurt Locker.&#034;)
But it&#039;s all no more bizarre than a former husband and former wife dueling for the top awards in showbiz.
