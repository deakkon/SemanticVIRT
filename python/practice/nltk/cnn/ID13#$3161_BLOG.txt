		Nigel Lythgoe says no more mean &#039;Idol&#039;	
Doesn’t sound like “American Idol’s” Nigel Lythgoe is going to miss Simon Cowell at all next season.
The producer tells Emmy Magazine that “If you like people being mean to people, you’ll miss it” – an apparent dig at the acerbic Cowell, who left the show last season.
Lythgoe returns this season to the show, which has seen its ratings dip from the ginormous numbers of the past. He told the publication he thinks the talent competition will go on even without fan favorite Cowell, and he praised new judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler.
