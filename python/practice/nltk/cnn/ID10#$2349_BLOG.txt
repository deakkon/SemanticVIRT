Dogs bark and whine behind high chain-link fences, some of them gnawing the wire so hard they bleed at the mouths while cats packed into crowded cages cower in fear if anyone approaches.


Ban cat and dog meat?



This isn&#039;t a pet store - it&#039;s a meat market in Guangzhou, a city in southern China where eating cats and dogs is common practice.
At the Han River Dog Meat Restaurant in central Guangzhou, diners can choose from a long list of menu items, including dog soup, dog steak, dog with tofu and more. In the kitchen, the chef chops up meat for dog hot pot, one of the more popular dishes. Most customers like it spicy.
But these local restaurants may have to find a new specialty. The Chinese government is considering legislation that would make eating cats and dogs illegal.
Eating dog meat is a long-standing culinary tradition in places like China and Korea and cat meat can be found on the menu in China, Vietnam and even parts of South America.
The Chinese government has already signaled a willingness to take the meat off the market. 
The ban on eating dog and cat meat is part of a larger proposal to toughen laws on animal welfare. Individual violators could face up to 15 days in prison and a small fine. Businesses found guilty of selling the meat risk fines up to 500,000 yuan or US$73,500.
We want to know what you think. 
Should people be banned from eating cat and dog meat in restaurants? Perhaps it should be allowed because of cultural reasons? </strong>
