                    Jay Leno:'I think Conan will come back'STORY HIGHLIGHTS Jay Leno says he expects Conan O'Brien will return to late-night television  HLN's Joy Behar interviewed Leno backstage at &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;  Leno has returned to his old post after NBC canceled his prime-time show  Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Jay Leno expects Conan O'Brien will return to late-night television as a head-to-head competitor against NBC's &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot; &quot;I think Conan will come back, and he'll be strong and, you know, we'll all compete against one another,&quot; Leno told Joy Behar, host of HLN's &quot;The Joy Behar Show.&quot; &quot;It should be me against [David] Letterman, against Conan, against [Jimmy] Kimmel, and then you see who wins,&quot; he said, referring to all the other late-night comedians. Behar turned the table -- or the couch -- on Leno while waiting backstage Tuesday for her &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance. &quot;Do you feel upset about Conan?&quot; Behar asked Leno.

&quot;Conan got screwed, and I got screwed,&quot; Leno said. &quot;This is TV. The reason how business pays a lot of money is, when you get screwed you have something left over.&quot; When NBC yanked Leno off his 10 p.m. show and returned him to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; host chair, O'Brien was paid in excess of $32 million. He's free to host another talk show after September 1. &quot;It worked out OK,&quot; Leno said. &quot;I don't quite get why I get beat up over it. I know people don't really understand sort of how this business works. It's all numbers. You know, the affiliates wanted us back, so we came back.&quot; NBC's local stations suffered a drop in ratings for their 11 p.m. newscasts in the months that Leno's earlier show was a lead-in. Leno told Behar he does not take personally all the jokes and criticisms from other comedians about his acceptance of the NBC plan to dump O'Brien. &quot;All comedians are friends, but when you go onstage your job is to blow the other guys off the stage,&quot; he said. &quot;I get it. That's the way it works. I don't want to impede anyone else's opportunity, but when you go out there that's what you do.&quot; The uncertainty of television is why he will keep his other job as a nightclub stand-up comedian, he said. &quot;That's why I always tell comics, keep your act,&quot; he said.  Indeed, Leno flew to Las Vegas after his Tuesday taping to do a 10 p.m. show.
