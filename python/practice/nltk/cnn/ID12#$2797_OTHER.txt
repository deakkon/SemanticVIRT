					Suspension Bridging
		
		
			
				In the Pilates approach in midtown Manhattan&#39;s Backbone and Wingspan, the perfect balance between tone, efficient movement support, and release of tightness or pain is what we shoot for in each exercise.
A way to think about bridging that will keep you from overworking the belly part of the hamstring is to visualize the quality of a suspension bridge. A mooring is defined in Wikipedia as:any device used to hold secure an object by means of cables, anchors, or lines Any bridge has a. mooring which would be where the cables would be tethered down into a stable point. The sitbones can be utilized like moorings for the hamstrings to be tethered to.What gives the actual bridge suspension are the coiled cables that
reach down into the moorings. What gives the bridging movement
suspension is tethering the hamstrings to the sit bones and uncoiling
the calves into the Achilles.The sit bones are the moorings that the hamstrings tether to for stability.
