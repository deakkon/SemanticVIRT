 (CNN) -- Iran has launched a new guided missile destroyer Friday, Iran's state-run news agencies reported. The announcement comes at a time when nuclear watchdogs have accused Iran of working to develop a nuclear warhead for a missile. The new vessel, called Jamaran, has the capacity to carry about 120 people and is armed with surface-to-air missiles, torpedoes and modern naval cannons, Iran's Press TV reported. The ship is constitutes a major leap in Iran's naval technology and is the first in a class of ships that are being constructed, Press TV reported. The announcement comes a day after the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency said Iran may be working secretly to develop a nuclear warhead for a missile. The assertion was part of a draft report by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
