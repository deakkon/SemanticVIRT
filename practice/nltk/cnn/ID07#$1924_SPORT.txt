  Running back LaDainian Tomlinson will visit with the Vikings on Thursday, a league source said.     Minnesota is seeking to replace Chester Taylor, an eight-year veteran who signed a free-agent deal with the Bears on Friday. The Vikings have Pro Bowl starting running back Adrian Peterson, but are looking for a capable complement, particularly in passing situations.     Tomlinson, who was released last month after nine years with San Diego -- where he set or tied 28 franchise records, including career rushing yards and touchdowns -- has had at least 50 receptions eight times. He also is a sure-handed ball-carrier, which is attractive to the Vikings because Peterson lost six fumbles in 314 carries last season. Tomlinson has lost only seven fumbles in his last 2,541 carries.     This will be the first visit for Tomlinson since being cut by San Diego. He recently said he has no problem sharing the backfield and believes he could be a positive mentor for a young back.
