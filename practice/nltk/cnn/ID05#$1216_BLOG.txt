		It&#039;s a Disney takeover on &#039;American Idol&#039;	
			
Miley Cyrus will appear on &#034;American Idol&#034; Tuesday as a guest mentor, guiding the 11 finalists through the Billboard No.1 Hits-themed show.
The recording artist and actress will also appear on &#034;Idol’s&#034; Wednesday results show, where she’ll perform “When I Look at You” - the song featured in “The Last Song” trailer. 
Fellow Disney Stars, Joe Jonas and Demi Lovato - who will inevitably be referred to as ‘Jemi’ now that they&#039;ve gone public with their relationship - will also perform Wednesday. The couple will sing “Make a Wave,” a duet they recorded for Disney’s &#034;Friends for Change: Project Green,&#034; which will be featured in the upcoming film, “Oceans.” 
This is Jonas’ second time on the show. He made his &#034;American Idol&#034; Debut when he appeared as a guest judge during the Dallas, Texas, auditions.
