An actress with Down syndrome who guest-starred on the animated show “Family Guy” thinks Sarah Palin just doesn’t get the joke.
The former vice-presidential candidate and Alaskan governor slammed the Fox animated series after the show racked up some laughs with a line she felt mocked her family.
On a recent episode, a character with Down syndrome named Ellen goes on a date with one of the show’s teenaged characters, Chris. Ellen tells Chris that her mother is “the former governor of Alaska.”

Actress Andrea Fay Friedman voiced Ellen and told The New York Times she guessed that “former Governor Palin does not have a sense of humor.”
“I thought the line ‘I am the daughter of the former governor of Alaska’ was very funny,” Friedman said in an e-mail to the paper. “I think the word is ‘sarcasm.’ ”
The 39-year-old actress has Down syndrome and is an outspoken advocate for people like herself. Palin has a young son with Down syndrome and said that the joke was the product of “cruel, cold-hearted people.”
