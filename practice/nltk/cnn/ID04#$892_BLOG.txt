		Conan O&#039;Brien&#039;s tour employs former &#039;Tonight Show&#039; crew	
			
Conan O&#039;Brien tweeted yesterday that he&#039;s taking his act on the road with the &#034;Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television&#034; tour.
Tickets for the 32-city tour are selling out around the country, with the option to include pricey add-ons like &#034;Meet and Greet&#034; packages, which can cost in the neighborhood of $600.
Although O&#039;Brien is currently out of a job as a late-night TV host, TMZ is reporting that proceeds from the show won&#039;t be added to his bank account. O&#039;Brien&#039;s tour, which wraps in Atlanta in June, is going to keep his former &#034;Tonight Show&#034; crew gainfully employed until his next on-air gig. As a source close to O&#039;Brien told CNN: He&#039;s clearly not doing this for the money.
