			Steve Jobs and his new iPad
	The &#034;magical and revolutionary&#034; moment is finally here.  Apple is allowing fans the opportunity to pre-order the new iPad starting today.
	In preparation for the onslaught, the Apple Store was down early Friday with a yellow sticky pad saying, &#034;We&#039;ll be back soon.&#034;  The store since has reopened and are now taking pre-orders for Apple&#039;s latest creation.  
	Even though you can order today, the iPad wonâ€™t be in the customer&#039;s hands until April 3rd.  Our partners at Mashable say &#034;this moment is exciting because from now on, Apple (and, hopefully, the media) will have some idea how well this thing actually sells.&#034;
	Will you be one of the first to order? Are you going to wait?  Or do you even want to get an iPad anyway?
