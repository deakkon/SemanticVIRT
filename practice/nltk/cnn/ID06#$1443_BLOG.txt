		Matt Damon attached to RFK biopic	

Deadline Hollywood reports that Matt Damon has been tapped to portray Robert F. Kennedy in a new biopic based on the Evan Thomas biography, &#034;Robert Kennedy: His Life.&#034;
Damon&#039;s rep confirmed to CNN that Damon is attached to the project, and added that it&#039;s still in the very early stages of development.
The actor has been riding a wave of critical success as of late with leading roles in two of 2009&#039;s notable films, &#034;The Informant!&#034; as well as &#034;Invictus,&#034; the latter of which has earned Damon an Oscar nod for best supporting actor.
Do you think he can pull off the role of RFK? And if not Damon, who?
