 (CNN) -- The space shuttle Endeavour landed Sunday night at Kennedy Space Center after a two-week mission to the international space station. &quot;It's great to be home and it was a great adventure,&quot; Cmdr. George Zamka said upon landing. While on the mission, the crew delivered a third connecting module, an Italian-built Tranquility node and a seven-windowed cupola to be used as a control room for robotics. The crew also conducted three spacewalks. The 5.7 million-mile mile mission was Endeavour's 10th trip to the space station, according to NASA. The space station, which orbits the Earth at a height of 250 miles, is due to be completed next year. It's now about 90 percent complete. Four more shuttle launches are scheduled before the program ends.
