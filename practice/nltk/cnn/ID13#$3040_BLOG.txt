Sam Goodman is a Canadian who went to China in 1995 to study Mandarin. Along the way, a craving for Western sandwiches made him an accidental entrepreneur, as creating food for foreign students turned into the restaurant “Beijing Sammies.” Goodman eventually opened five locations with a 100-person staff and $1 million in revenue. Goodman got out of the sandwich business and is now a management consultant and chief operating officer of Climate Action, an environmental services company. But his experience as an entrepreneur in China – navigating a nuanced landscape of cultural, political and economic hills to climb – led to his book, &#034;Where East Eats West: The Street Smarts Guide to Business in China.&#034;

Goodman shares his short list of top biz mistakes Westerners make in China.
 1. Any variation of “doing-things-like-you -did-back-home.”
You’re not back home anymore.
2. Overestimating the mystique of Face and Guanxi (network/relationship)
Understanding the concept of face in China is important, but Goodman says don&#039;t over-mystify it. To put it simply, face is appearance over substance. Goodman writes, &#034;It&#039;s not just what you say, but how you say it.  Did you say the right things? (What you thought doesn&#039;t really matter.)&#034;
3. Misunderstanding how (much) Face and Guanxi affects your business.
&#034;In the West, if you make a mistake it&#039;s understood that this happens. If you fall off your horse, you get back on. In China if you do something wrong, your family loses face. That&#039;s much more important.&#034;
4. Seeing China as one market
&#034;Western Companies need to understand that China is really many markets (just like Europe) with different characteristics.&#034;
5. Miscommunication
China is a “high context” communication culture, which is to say the words used is the least important tool. The situation – how, when and who is saying what – speaks more than words.
6. Thinking a contract is binding
&#034;In the West, a contract is black and white. In China, it&#039;s relationship based. Don&#039;t be surprised if after you sign a contract in China, the Chinese come back and want to re-discuss a clause.&#034;
7.  Long term goals with no term implementation
&#034;Large corporations come into China with a &#039;long term strategy&#034;, then bleed money month after month, year after year always thinking that things will turn around in a few years and the bleeding period is necessary to &#039;lay a foundation&#039;.&#034;
8. Confusing language skills with management or business skills
A good Mandarin or English speaker doesn’t necessarily mean they have a head for business.
 9. Assuming price and quality are connected
&#034;Westerners tend to think: the higher the price, the higher the quality. In China, asking a high price is an issue of Face.&#034;
10. Managing by remote control
In his book, Goodman writes, &#034;Folks here like to make deals eyeball to eyeball with people they know who also know other people they know.&#034;
