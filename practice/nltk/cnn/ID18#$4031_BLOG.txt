		Conan O&#039;Brien tweets a plea for help	

In our continued watch of &#034;Celebrities Joining Twitter 2010,&#034; we&#039;ve received word that the dolphin-smooching, out-of-work Conan O&#039;Brien is the latest to sign up.
With the simple Twitter handle of &#034;ConanOBrien,&#034; the former late night talk show host has tweeted just once, but already has more than 245,000 followers at the time of this posting.
O&#039;Brien, who has laid fairly low since he left &#034;The Tonight Show&#034; in late January, informed Twitter users yesterday that he&#039;s exhibiting a few symptoms of withdrawal.
&#034;Today I interviewed a squirrel in my backyard and then threw to commercial,&#034; he tweeted. &#034;Somebody help me.&#034;
Even his bio is a characteristically self-deprecating: &#034;I had a show. Then I had a different show. Now I have a Twitter account.&#034;
