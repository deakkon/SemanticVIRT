Andrew Koenig's sister joins Larry King to discuss the latest on her missing brother. &quot;Larry King Live,&quot; Tuesday, 10 ET.  Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Police in Vancouver, Canada, say they have &quot;received a substantial amount of tips and information&quot; in their search for Andrew Koenig, who is best known for his role on the 1980s sitcom &quot;Growing Pains.&quot; The actor was last seen on Valentine's Day at a bakery in Vancouver, where he was visiting friends. His parents, Walter and Judy Koenig, have said they received a letter from him about that time in which he wrote in a &quot;despondent tone.&quot; The Koenigs plan to meet with investigators in Vancouver on Tuesday, Walter Koenig said. Police said in a statement that they have received a lot of information since Koenig was reported missing and &quot;investigative avenues are being checked and re-checked.&quot; Vancouver Police Constable Tim Fanning, speaking to HLN's &quot;Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell,&quot; said investigators have worked around the clock since getting the missing persons report Thursday. &quot;There's nothing right now to believe that anything has happened to him,&quot; Fanning said Monday evening. &quot;We're certainly very concerned, as (are) his family and friends. But there's no evidence to believe that there's foul play involved at this point.&quot; Walter Koenig -- an actor known for his role as Pavel Chekov in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series -- called police two days after his 41-year-old son missed his flight home to Los Angeles, California. &quot;People don't just fall off the face of the map without, obviously, having some sort of problems, and we're hoping that maybe he's just trying to lie low and, you know, spend some time by himself,&quot; Fanning said. ATM transactions and cell phone records have given police some clues, he said. &quot;Perhaps he will hear the news reports of all the worry and concern, or somebody out there will be able to report that they've seen him,&quot; Fanning said. Evidence that Koenig has been despondent recently has increased the concern. His parents last talked to him on February 9, a week before he failed to board his flight home, a family statement said. &quot;Andrew was suffering from depression at the time of his disappearance,&quot; the family said. A statement posted on Walter Koenig's personal Web site said, &quot;Andrew sold or gave away a number of his possessions before flying to Canada and he refused a job, saying he 'wasn't going to work anymore.' &quot; Walter Koenig said he did not believe there was one specific incident that led to his son's disappearance. &quot;I think it's something that has been a part of his makeup for a long time,&quot; he said. &quot;There's no single trauma. There's no episode. There's nothing of that nature.&quot; He also said drugs were not an issue. Lance Miccio, a close friend, agreed. &quot;Its something he's been dealing with his whole life,&quot; Miccio told Velez-Mitchell. &quot;It's not a sudden occurrence. This is something that he's, you know, he's dealt with, too.&quot; The actor is described as being 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 135 pounds, with brown shoulder-length hair and brown eyes, authorities said. Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to notify police. Koenig appeared in 25 episodes of &quot;Growing Pains&quot; from 1985 to 1989, playing Richard &quot;Boner&quot; Stabone, according to a filmography posted on the Internet Movie Database Web site. He also has appeared in episodes of several other television shows. He is described as &quot;a gifted and passionate multi-talented young man&quot; on his father's Web site. Other credits include &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,&quot; &quot;My Two Dads,&quot; &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; and the film &quot;The Theory of Everything.&quot; Koenig is also an activist with an interest in many causes, his father's Web site says. He was arrested at the Rose Bowl in 2008 while protesting U.S. involvement in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in China. He opposed U.S. participation because of China's support for a repressive regime in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, the Web site says. While the Koenigs are reaching out for public help, their son's disappearance is too painful for them to appear on camera to talk about , Walter Koenig told CNN. &quot;I tried it once, and it was just too difficult,&quot; he said.
