2010 NCAA Tournament Projection


Selection Sunday is not until March 14, but it's never too early to see what the 2010 NCAA Tournament field looks 

like as of right now. Note: The top-four 

seeds in each region, starting with the No. 1 seeds, receive geographic preference when possible. An imbalance in 

high seeds between regions (e.g. if more 

than two top-four seeds are closest to the same subregional location) may force a protected seed into a secondary 

location. Thus, in the coming weeks, shifts 

in seeding will alter which subregions fall into which regions. In this bracket, the Midwest matches 

up with the East, the South with the West in the national semifinals.</i>

New multi-bid conference teams in: San Diego State, Saint Mary's. 
Multi-bid conference teams out: Cincinnati, Dayton. 
Also considered: Dayton, Cincinnati, Minnesota, UConn, William & Mary, UAB. 
Bids by conference: Big East, ACC and Big 12 (7); Big Ten, SEC and Atlantic 10 (5); Mountain West (4); West Coast (2). 

Auto bids in smaller conferences were determined by best RPI among all first-place (e.g. fewest losses) teams in the league. One-bid league winners and select other auto-bid teams are listed with their conference for clarity. Teams can be moved a seed line up or down to conform to bracketing rules. 
BRIEF THOUGHTS
Why they made it:
-- Charlotte: Still has three very strong wins, including road W's at Richmond and Louisville. Barely fourth in A-10 pecking order ahead of URI and Dayton. 
-- Saint Mary's: Benefits from a couple teams dropping past it. Plus, the Gaels won. Wins at Utah State and over San Diego State are looking stronger. Just missed last week; just made it this week.

-- Rhode Island: Same basic script as last week: Win at Dayton is saving the Rams, who only remained in because some other teams around them lost.

-- San Diego State: A couple of buckets away from 10 straight wins in MWC. Third place in solid league with two very solid wins. January road losses at Wyoming and UNLV have injury asterisk from Billy White's ankle. Nominally the most appealing of some subpar options. Strongly considered Cincinnati, Dayton and Minnesota for this spot and Rhode Island's.

Why they didn't make it:
-- Dayton: Second suspect loss in a week pushes Flyers back into sixth place in the league and out of the bracket. Way too many close losses, not quite enough actual wins.
-- Cincinnati: Too many losses at this point. Could argue that wins over Vandy and Maryland (both on neutral courts) and a sweep of UConn, plus no bad losses, is better than what SDSU has done.
-- Minnesota: No good true road wins. Only 3-8 overall away from home and 4-8 versus top 100.
