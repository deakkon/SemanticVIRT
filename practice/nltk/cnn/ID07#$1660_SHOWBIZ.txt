 (PEOPLE.com) -- It was a family affair at Justin Timberlake's William Rast fashion show on Wednesday: The singer's parents Lynn and Paul Harless sat in the front row next to his girlfriend Jessica Biel, whom Lynn calls &quot;one of us.&quot; &quot;She's amazing. She's so down-to-earth and her family is great,&quot; said Lynn, adding that her son and Biel click because &quot;they're both very funny and creative.&quot; Not to mention thoughtful. &quot;They're always trying to out 'special' each other,&quot; said Lynn. &quot;They're pretty openly affectionate.&quot; Timberlake's longtime friend and Tennman Records artist Matt Morris and Vogue editor Anna Wintour also watched from the front row as models showcased the fall 2010 collection, which Timberlake and best friend Trace Ayala created to convey a &quot;nomadic discoverer,&quot; said Timberlake, 29. &quot;The landscape of the Midwest was really the prominent theme that we kept coming back to,&quot; he also said. &quot;It was really inspiring.&quot; During the show, which was sponsored by Sony, Biel, 27, often leaned over to whisper to a friend in the seat next to her about the different looks. Models donned military-inspired coats and foxtail-covered shoes. &quot;Tonight is my first time seeing the whole collection,&quot; Biel told PEOPLE. No surprise considering the actress's active schedule. Along with promoting her new film Valentine's Day, she climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro last month to raise awareness and funds for the global water crisis. &quot;She was at my house around Christmas and there was this crazy noise coming from my gym,&quot; says Lynn. No, it wasn't Santa. &quot;To get ready for the climb, [Jessica] had the treadmill to the highest level and was running with a 40-lb. backpack,&quot; says Lynn, adding with a laugh: &quot;I want to be her when I grow up.&quot; So, is Biel &quot;The One&quot; for her son? &quot;You should ask him. I've thought that before,&quot; Lynn says with her fingers crossed. &quot;They're young. They have plenty of time.&quot; Just don't wait too long, Justin. Mom is eager for tiny Timberlakes. &quot;I've had friends who have grandchildren and I've tried to express to him that I'm losing that race!&quot; she says. &quot;But I have grandpuppies. Justin has two boxers and she has a pitbull who's now part of the family. I said I'll leave you alone about the grandkids as long as you leave the puppies with me.&quot; See the original article at PEOPLE.com.&copy; 2010 People and Time Inc.
