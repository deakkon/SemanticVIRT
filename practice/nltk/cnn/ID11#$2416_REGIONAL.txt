 Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The captors of a kidnapped 5-year-old British boy included someone who was close to the family, Pakistan's Interior Minister said Sunday. &quot;There is someone who is very close to the family because the way the situation happened; the way the entry was made,&quot; Minister Rehman Malik said. Malik, who spoke to reporters after meeting the boy's father in the Pakistani town of Jhelum, said authorities were close to finding the kidnappers. &quot;We have certain leads which we would not like to disclose, but I have a warning to those who abducted the boy: leave the boy because we are very near to you,&quot; he said. The boy, Sahil Saeed, is of Pakistani descent. He was on the last day of a two-week vacation in Pakistan before he planned to return home to Oldham in northern England. Gunmen barged into Sahil's grandmother's home in the eastern province of Punjab and took him at gunpoint Wednesday. They have reportedly demanded a ransom of 10 million rupees ($118,000).
