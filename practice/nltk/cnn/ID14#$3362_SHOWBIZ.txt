 Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Burt Reynolds is feeling great now that he &quot;has a great motor with brand new pipes,&quot; his manager said Wednesday. Doctors at a Florida hospital performed a planned heart bypass operation on the veteran actor last week, Erik Kritzer said. He did not name the hospital. &quot;All reports that are implying he was rushed to a hospital are completely untrue, as he has had this operation scheduled for over a month,&quot; Kritzer said. Reynolds, who celebrated his 74th birthday last month, returned home to continue his &quot;speedy recovery,&quot; he said. In September, Reynolds checked into a drug rehab clinic &quot;to regain control of his life&quot; after becoming addicted to painkillers prescribed following back surgery, his manager said. Reynolds was an Academy Award nominee and Golden Globe winner for his role as a porn producer in the 1997 movie &quot;Boogie Nights.&quot; His film career, which started in 1961, also included starring roles in the movies &quot;Deliverance,&quot; &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; and &quot;Cannonball Run.&quot;CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.
