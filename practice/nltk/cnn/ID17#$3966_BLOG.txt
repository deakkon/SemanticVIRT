They were responding to a report of a disturbance involving weapons at a house in a rural area of Liberty County, northeast of Houston, said Hugh Bishop, a spokesman for the Liberty Police Department.
Someone started shooting at the deputies as they arrived at the house just after 5 a.m., he said. That person died of a gunshot wound, but investigators do not know if he shot himself or if a law-enforcement officer shot him, Bishop said.
Deputy Rex Evans, 40, was released from a hospital after being treated for a superficial wound while Deputy Jeremy Marcantel, 33, was shot in the upper part of his body, Bishop said.
Both wounded law-enforcement officers work for the Liberty County Sheriff&#039;s Department.
Investigators do not yet know what prompted the shooting, which happened in the Woodland Hills area of Liberty County, just north of the city of Dayton.
